People from diff circles of life. Write each of their names at the top of two separate sheets of paper. \nWrite one paragraph from each person,recording what they would say about you today-right now. Include the highs and the lows:write the unedited,candid,truth even if that means including details that you’d prefer them not to remember or say in their descriptions of you. Some things to think about as you do this are your dominant personality traits,your strengths,your weaknesses,your chosen career,your spirit,your contributions to society,your talents,your hobbies,passions and so on \nNow write a second paragraph for each person recording what you think these 2 people would say about you three years from now. Assume that you have mastered everything you’ve ever wanted to master- in mind,in spirit,in body,in career,in finances- in everything. You’ve become everything you’ve wanted to become. You’ve surpassed all the frustrations and challenges in your life and you are exactly where you wat to be. Now what would hose paragraphs reveal about you? How big did  you play in the universe How many lives did you impact? How did your children look at you? What legacy did you leave that was larger than you as an individual? \nUsing a different color ink than the one you used above, circle the characteristics in the first paragraphs that you didn’t feel good writing and that you didn’t want to write (if you haven’t written, write them now)These are the things  you don’t want to be remembered for.\nIn the second set of paragraphs, circle the acknowledgment, words of praise that reflect who you are. Circle the ones that you know deep down in your heart are how you want to be remembered. Clearly, this is where you want to focus your efforts, your energy, and your enthusiasm. \n\nA lot of participants had tears in their eyes post this exercise\n\nBeing in cause/effect\n-moving from victim to victorious \n-shared story of my life, how I stayed in victim and moved to victory \nExercise  : Which area of your life needs to change right now?\nHow can you shift it and be in a cause of that situation rather than being in effect \nWhat is the benefit of staying where you are staying right now? \nWhat will be the advantages of moving to the other side? \nWhat will change in your life if you move to the other side that you would never want to change? \nAre you willing to let go of that comfort zone now? \n\nI took a participant – did a breakthrough and showed how being in effect has advantages.  Then asked the particpants to do the above exercise and did a class share and partner share \n\nPost lunch \nActivity:\nChoose  a partner. One partner does an action and other one copies it. Keep copying your partner. Now swap. \nNow one partner does an action and you have to do something completely opposite. Do exactly opposite of what your partner does.\nOutcome- we constantly copy others unknowingly, doing something different is so unusual,diffciult and uncomfortable. \nAssignment: For next 1 week find different ways to do everything that you are doing in your day to day life \nTheory of mind \nExplained the theory of mind and gave examples, client stories on how our beliefs show up in different areas of life and how it rejects anything that is not a part of its reality. \n\n100% responsibility of life – \nStory- client  story of blaming everyone else and how her life shifted by taking responsibility\nActivity- EFt on taking up 100% responsibility of life.

Your focus should be that the person next to you is not moving, if the person moves they lose.  \n-outcome- how come all of you moved so soon. Where was your focus? \nRepeat the same exercise- now focus that your body should be still and if you move then you lose. Which one was easier? \nStory- My story of my focus on my husband and what he is not doing. How the minute I changed my focus on my self automatically he took charge of his responsibilities.\n-	Where is your focus in life right now?\n-	Who are you waiting to change for you to see that change? \n-	Story- SHILPA & NINU (clients) \n-	Energy flows where your focus goes \nSteps to make the change: \nList down failures\nWrite down what did you learn from situations/experiences in life, that you wouldn’t have learnt if you wouldn’t have gone through it. \nHow has those hurts made you a better person that you wouldn’t have been if you wouldn’t have gone through them ( my story of my marriage) \nSearch for your gifts in each circumstance\nYOUR PAST IS NOT WHO YOU ARE IT HAS ONLY HELPED YOU TO BECOME WHO YOU ARE \nSTORY - MY PAST HELPED ME TO BECOME A TRANSFORMATION COACH \n\n\nDay II \nAccepting your power \nStory- client story of how clients are happier and taking decision of their choice,the minute they are unaffected by husbands words. \n-	Dealing with the shit right in front of you\n-	Write down two to four experiences from your past that have caused you a great deal of pain and that still cause you to wonder why they happened to you. After each question write down WHY in big letters. Now answer each WHY with honesty and compassion in a way that honors the truth and honors you.  Refrain from making anyone wrong in your answers. Don’t beat yourself or anyone up. Allow every person involved to be growing and evolving just like you. \n-	This step is about completion so that you don’t carry the story in a disempowering way.\n-	\n-	changing the shit into a chocolate flavored cake\n-	What am I learning?\n-	How is my understanding being built through this situation?\n-	How will I be a better person on the other side of this opportunity for me to grow?\nMy story- being unaffected by mom’s words. \n(Do this exercise for next 21 days to make a habit of seeing the blessing in each situation)\n\n\nReact vs response \nWrite down instances in a piece of paper and each member reads his sheet and reacts based on what is written on the sheet. All interact with each other simultaneously based on the event continuing their reaction and guess others reactions. \nOutcome- how everyone else is carrying their own truck load of emotion and are reacting based on their emotions and not based on you. \n\n\n-	From reacting to response\n-	Your power lies in recognizing that in each new moment, we have the opportunity to make a new choice – a choice that will inspire us and leave us feeling powerful instead of powerless. \n-	Think of a situation in your life where you can now see that if you had responded differently, things would have turned out a great deal better for you. Keep this situation in your mind.\n-	Now imagine the other person acting and speaking the same way he or she did in the real scenario, but envision yourself choosing another response- one that would have shifted the entire experience.\n(my experience with chechi) \n(for ex: coul you have taken several deep breaths,thought through your next words, and showed more responsibility for what came out of our mouth? Could you have seen past a moment of anger inside and found more compassion for how hurt the other person was or how misdirect his or her  actions were? Can you see a different outcome based on your choice to respond in a new way? \n\nStanding in your power doesn’t mean knocking someone down. Standing in your power means standing tall and unaffected when someone knocks you down \n(story of my sister speaking critically during the pharma event and about the pharmaceutical company. How I  could joke around it and we both laugh over it.)\n\n\nBeing honest to your own self \nStory- client story of how she doesn’t know cooking and how she kept pretending snobbish and affected all areas of her life. \nActivity: \nIn a group each person stands and speaks a story. Some part of story is completely fake and made up and some part of it is true. Participants get chance to rehearse their story thoroughly. Story should have excitement, energy ,joy, sadness, anger into it and your words and body should match. \nOthers watch and silently take notes where they felt the participant is lying and the part that touched their heart. Do a discussion at the end. \n\nExercise : (partner share & class share)\n-	what actions do you currently need to take in life \n-	where in life can you be more authentic with your own self?\n-	Whats stopping you?\n-	Where in life can you be more authentic with others?\n-	What stopping you?\n-	What are you hiding from?\n-	What do you not want to face?\n-	What will change for you if you face this?\n-	What are you scared off?\nDid a breakthrough with a participant- who was looking for a job change of how we give excuses to ourselves and not face the actual reality. \nWhat you will find when you share yourself fully with those around you is that their love and admiration for you expands. Your truth becomes liberation for others. It frees them to find and share their own truth.\nA lot of us walk around as if blind folded and gagged, too afraid to see or speak the truth, andthis fear has paralyzed our growth. \nTake a stock of where your life is. Stock of your challenges and your wins.\nWe lie to ourselves when we pplay small in our lives, when we play it safe by settling for less than we know we can be and have. We end up hiding our dreams and aspirations behind a mask of mediocrity, people pleasing and conformity. \nSomeone else’s perception doesn’t determine who you are\nExercise:\nShare an incidence that you have been keeping to yourself for fear of judgment, embarrassment or ridicule.  \n\n\nFear of judgments \nStory- how I trapped myself under the fear of judgment for the longest part of life. \n-	What pushes your buttons in you?\n-	Who reactivates your buttons for you?\n-	Which of your victim stories are they triggering in you?\nBeing willing to be judged\nPeople can only love you to the capacity that they are able to love themselves. They can only forgive and embrace you to the capacity that they are able to forgive and embrace themselves. They can only give you what they have the capacity to give. \nYou may think that you deserve more, and you may be correct. But that means nothing if a person simply doesn’t have the ability to give it to you. \nActivity :\nBig glass with water. Pour it into a smaller glass. Do you expect the smaller glass to hold all the water? \nWhat makes you set up the other person for failure and yourself for disappointment by expecting larger amount of water?\nIt’s not your responsibility to grow other people. Your responsibility is to love them right where they are. \nPeople are dealing with their own junk in their trunk. You stop forcing people to be who you think they should be and begin loving, accepting, and celebrating them for who they are.\n\nBeing willing to be different- reminded about the copying and different exercise that we did \nFear of being alone – client story about how fear of being alone,  turned out to be fear of judgment and how it affected her lives. \n\nDay III\nStarted day with connecting to your uniqueness. Importance of playing full out. Some participants were at the verge of commiting suicide, spoke in general about how your beliefs are important, how when during those dark days of life its important to borrow someones faith in life. Spoke about how our mental chatter takes over and how we go unaware. How to be present to our talks.  How we can stop ourselves frm commiting suicide. How I got myself out of suicide. How to stand the dark days of life. Importance of having a bigger purpose, where your knowledge of your existence can stand by you. \nSelf esteem \nStory- my self belief. The labels I carried. How releasing the labels helped. \ncheck your mental chatter\nHow do you feel about yourself in your own private space.\nHow do you talk to yourself?\n-next time there is a mental chatter imagine it’s a tape recorder playing in your head. Imagine it as a  dual side player The negative tape is on the left and the positive is on the right. Next time you are litening to your negative talk actually take your index finger and press the left side of the tape and say STOP. Now press the right side and say RUN. \n\nExercise\nWhat are the lies that we have told to us about ourselves? Write them down.  Discuss with a partner how it is affecting your lives. \nGive each participant bunch of labels. On each label write down what are the tags that you are carrying with themselves. Write all the lies down. Now ask your partner to stick these labels firmly on different parts of your body. It needs to stick to your skin, not on clothes. Feel the label on your skin. Look at yourselves in the mirror. \nEFT on labels \nClosed eye process- released the labels by taking them in trance. Did a replacement instead of all the labels released. \nOpen your eyes – physically remove each label that is stuck on your body and crumble and put them in a bowl and flush them at the end. \n\nPost lunch\n\nExercise \nSit in a circle. Take a sheet of paper ontop of the sheet write your name. circulate the sheet with your name in the circle. Write 1 gud thing about the person whose name is on the sheet and pass it on. Continue this till you receive the sheet with your name on it back. Once you receive the sheet with your own name in it write 5 gud things about yourself starting with I am. Each of them reads the entire sheet aloud at the end. \n\nExercise \nForm a group of 3. Go to each person in the group and convince them how awesome you are. You must say it as if you mean it. Only if the person believes in you,then they will say I trust you .keep convincing till they don’t believe you. \nExercise \nScream loudly in the room. Make different voices and get the trapped energy out. \nExercise \nTake a chart paper. \nWrite all the mental chatter/lies that keeps coming to you with a pencil on the chart paper. After each lie leave 2-3 lines. Once you have finished writing all the negative chatter with a pencil, take a red ink pen and write down all the truths instead of the above negative chatter. \nFor few days keep reading the negative and positive both. After 3 days erase the entire negative statements and keep reading the positive ones everyday. \n\nThe outer reflects the inner\n-your belief about yourself will change outer circumstances for you\n-remember its upto you to show the world how to treat you\n\nWhich areas of your life can you start saying a NO \n-What are you hanging on to life that no longer serves you \n(relationship,job,house etc ) A lot of time even when it leaves us, and we know it wasn’t right for us, we still feel rejected.\n(This is because our need to be accepted and approved often supersedes our desire to be happy)\nWhich people can you start cutting down in life?\nHow can you raise to your full potential? \nSmita I am proud that you….\nSmita what I love about you is…\nSmita I forgive you for…. \nSmita I am committed to…\n\n(add 7 diff endings to each)\n\n\n\nDay IV \n\nForgivness \nAsk your partner like a loving friend How are you feeling? \nAnswer this question out lout by completing the following sentence stem at least  -7 times. Whats up with me right now is…. \n-Do any events in my life drain my spirit when I recall them?

One person takes to do the forgiveness. A representative takes over the energy of the person with whom the forgiveness needs to be done and stands opp to the participant. The participant has to look into the eyes of the representative and say the following sentences. Third person in the group facilitates the process by saying these sentences and asking the participant to complete it. Each takes turn doing all 3 roles.(3 times each)\nAnger\nI am angry that…\nI hate it when you\nI am really mad….\nI resent that \nHurt\nI feel hurt\nI am sad\nI feel disappointed about..\nFear\nI am afraid that I…\nI am scared that I…\n(I am scared because I think)\nI get afraid of you when…\nResponsibility\nI am sorry that I\nForgive me for\nI know that my part was\nI didn’t mean to…\nI take responsibility\nUnderstanding \nI understand that…\nWhat I know is…\n(when we open the door to understanding, we are able to forgive.

What made you accomplish the diifcult task ? \nImportance of focussing on the final outcome was learnt. \nDefine how important your goals are\n(take some time out. Close your eyes and visualize your goals. Now ask the following questions)\nWhy is this goal important to me? What value does it have in my life?\nWhat makes them so vital to me?\nWhat benefit could achieving this goal bring me? What joy will I gain? Wht freedom will I attain that I don’t currently have?\nWhat makes my goal worth fighting for? Working hard for? Staying up late for? Humbling myself for?? \nRecalling this feeling will enable you to look in the face of fear,frustration, exhaustion, and disappointment and move forward. \n\nDay V\nCourage:\nBuilding your courage\n-write down one area of your life where you need to build courage and take action \n-what action can you take\n- what stops you from taking that action \nWhat are your fears \nWhat actions can you take to deal with that fears \n(story of my drowning in water, story of my accident in highway) \n-script a situation that you are scared of before hand.

He didn’t quit playing. Play again and practice more. This time restructure your mental chatter. \nBe associated with people 9who are already excelling in your passion) and learn stories of their life.

Next to it write 3 areas of life which needs to be addressed and you are sitting on the nail. Place a nail of that size next to the number. (5 nails of diff sizes were given to the participant) \nBelow that write down actions you will take to keep reducing the size of the nail each day and give a realistic target of a  month when you want the entire nail to be gone.

For 5 meets if you haven’t taken any actions then you are blacklisted from the program. \nClass share of your actions and goals \n-	You strengthen your take action muscle by being 100 % committed to your desired outcome. I am not talking about buying a house, a car or a substantial bank account. I am talking about simpler perks of bigger, broader outcomes, living in your passion, serving your purpose, having meaningful relationships, feeling connected to a higher spirit\n-	When you become committed to reaching those outcomes than to having your plan work out just the way you designed it, at the pace you prefer, and with the people you’d like included, you’ll be inspired from such a deep, true place inside that you’ll become unstoppable. \nThere are moutain tops and there are valleys in life. When you are standing in your power, loving everything in life,, and your mind is at peace, those are the times you are on the top of your mountain. But when life seems out of balance, and you are struggling to deal with your thoughts and emotions, then you’ll know you’re standing in a valley between the mountain tops. When you find yourself in the valley, the most important thing to remember is doesn’t buy real estate there. Don’t bring your ipod, your furniture or any of your clothes. And please don’t throw any of your pity parties there  \nVisiting the valley is absolutely ok, relocating to the valley is not\nBuilding your faith \nImportance of building faith. My story in faith.

The session would have an exercise on ‘wheel of life’ in a relation to bring out the impact & importance in life. The exercise and a ‘Satisfaction Matrix’ are designed to correlate how ripples in a relation are affecting other areas of life. \nDay 2 – This will focus on the ‘Criteria/Rules’ in a relation. A home task is focused on the ‘rules’ in a relation. An important element in a relation ‘Rapport’ will be discussed with an activity. The assignment on this would be discussed during the virtual session. \nDay 3 – This will focus on ‘Values Hierarchy’ and ‘revive your connections’ by taking actions to resolve it. The tool that will help elicit ‘Value Hierarchy’ of an individual will be done in the workshop. The session will also focus on the ‘Shoe Walk’ talk.

There is one more side to me. From the age of 18 I have been involved in some business  activity or the other.  I have sold printing ink and I have sold packed food products like jam and vermicelli. From this I got into sale of industrial products. From here I got into manufacture of gift items. This grew into a big factory with lots of workers. I used to take really good care of my workers. Even a third standard failed person was making 4000 rupees per month, and I am talking of the period before the year 2000. In 2000, after diwali festival the workers went on strike and some union person sent us a notice.  The union person came to us for negotiations but I threw him out. I told him to go to court and if the court ordered me to give any compensation, I would pay double. But I would not negotiate with the unions. I decided to close down the factory.  All my workers came back and prayed that we should not close down and that they wanted  to come back. But I was feeling very hurt by their earlier stand and had already made up my mind to shut down. We closed up in 2000. There was money but no work.  That was bad, really bad. Depressing state. I would be in college for 4 hours everyday but what to do with the remaining day.\nSometime in the year 2004, I got interested in the subject of wellness. I was always a voracious reader, so I started reading on the subject of wellness. I also started attending all the available healing courses in Mumbai. There were very few of them available at that time. I also did a lot of experimentation with different techniques like reiki, pranic healing, graphology, numerology, vaastu, clinical hypnosis, different types of meditations, study of yantras and mantras and many more such modalities.  I had found something to be occupied with.\nIn 2006, I met Dr. Jiten Bhatt and was introduced to pyramids by him. He had done wonderful work on the use of Pyramid for achieving different results.\n(  EXPERIENCE  STORY N LEARNING )\n I jumped into this subject and started working with these tools and I was surprised by the results that could be achieved. More about this work I will elaborate later.\nIn the meantime in 2005 I started an office at the City Center Mall in goregaon. I started giving past life regression / therapy sessions, reiki healings, graphology reports, numerology reports for a variety of clients. I also started doing experiments with the different ways to heal  the homes and offices for my clients.\nLet me tell you about a few of these experiments.\n(  STORYOF EXPERIENCES OF MY RELATIVES N FRIENDS)\nI was originally working with the traditional remedies while doing vaastu. Many a times the results were not upto the expectations of my clients and nor was I happy  with them. So after 2006, I started using pyramids for vaastu remedy and I started getting consistently good results. So my trust in the pyramid tools was enhanced. I decided to explore  this tool for therapies in different situations. I experimented with pyramids on health.  I had a friend who was found to be suffering from cancer and that too at the 4th stage. The doctors gave no hope and only one and a half month to live. She of course did not want to go and also wanted to avoid the painful  chemotherapy.  The chemos could not be avoided. I gave her a pyramid tool. She could complete the chemotherapy comfortably with minimum pain. With regular use of the pyramid she managed to live for 11 months and when the end came, it was with no pain. She passed away painlessly and with all her financial and legal affairs well attended to.        \nOn another occasion, I used  the pyramid to heal a paralysis patient to get well and resume his daily routine in less than two months. This patients age was73 years and the doctors had told the family that he would be bed ridden till death.\nNow who amongst you would like to learn this technology? You will be able to help your family members to overcome health issues. \nLet me assure you all that it is not difficult to learn and practice it. And I have been teaching this for the past 8 years and evolved a 4 step system for you to master this.\nBut Complete Wellbeing is not focused only on health. \nI continued with my experiments in different areas of human experience of life. \nA friend of mine  called me one and started telling me all his woes about his sales team. Whatever  training he would impart and all his pep talks were failing. They just were not able to clock in sales. I heard him out.  I asked him how the sales team worked. He explained that they would call prospects in the morning on their mobile phones, take appointments and then visit the party. the situation wasso bad that they would not even get appointments many a times. This was also the time when the story that talking on mobiles would fry up your brains was making rounds. I promised to help my friend.  I designed a tool based on pyramids  which was to be paired with the mobile. This tool would protect one from harmful radiation and also would help to improved connectedness with the  person being called. This connectedness will improve sales. So I gave my friend a few of these tools which were given to the salespeople. I told them to use these tools with a open mind.  MARTA KYA NA KARTA. They used the tools. My friend was overjoyed by the results.  It was a complete success.   Even I use that tool and it has given me tremendous results. \nWho amongst you would like to use such a tool?\nTo continue with my experiments, I tried the use of pyramids in various areas like relationships, marriage, protection from evil and negative energies. \n( STORY ON GETTING AN OVERAGED GIRL MARRIED  )\n(  STORY ON REMOVING SPIRITS FROM AN OLD FLAT  )\nSo, now imagine if you could learn to do this for your clients. What would the client be ready to pay if you can rid his home or office of negative energies in a completely scientifically explainable way with no mumbo jumbo involved? And above all the results would be permanent.\nA lot of ladies would come to me with problems with their childrens’ study issue. Mother’s are never satisfied by their child’s performance in school.  All I needed to do was talk to the kids and then give them a tool and telling them how to use it and promising them magic with their results. In the last so many not a single parent has come back to me with a complaint.\nIf you focus only on this market, I am sure you will make a fortune.   \nI further experimented with meditation techniques using pyramids. The results were just great. I asked other meditators for their feedback using my technique. The results were uniformly great for all of them.\nUsing pyramids, I have improved people’s businesses also.\nSo, you see, I have designed a whole system to use pyramids to improve and positively impact any area of your life or all areas of your life.  And the good news is that you can also learn and apply it to your life and to the life of your clients. I have designed a simple 4 step system which if you use will make you a master  of this technology.  I could design this simple 4 step system as I have been in academics and a teacher for 33 years now. And now I want to offer it to you.\nYou see it is like this. I have been able to help more than 2000 people/ families in the last 11 years. But after surveying the whole country, I have come to the conclusion that about 5 lakh Complete Wellbeing experts are needed if we have to help willing to pay clients. And my calculations show that all these experts can be gainfully occupied for the rest of their life. There will be enough paying clients for everyone and good money for everyone of them. You could also do this work as a part time activity.\nOn my own, I am clear that even if I work round the clock I will not be able to create 5 lakh experts. So there is enough work and huge incomes to be had. So who would like to get into this activity?\nWhat does this work offer you?\n1>	This work will give you the opportunity to contribute to your clients well being and happiness.\n2>	This work will make you confidant and fearless.\n3>	 You will earn everybody’s respect and gratitude.\n4>	You will emerge as a positive leader amongst your people.\n5>	You will make a good income.\n6>	A life long journey of growth and creativity\n\n\n', 0),

Awareness – the big Picture - Reframing your thoughts\n2.	Attitude - building Resilience, self-confidence and a kick ass attitude\n3.	Authenticity – building trust by discovering your delivery style/ effortless communication/ leveraging your strengths (finding your strengths and adding to it)\n•	Bringing power, energy  and self confidence to your voice – practising/breathing\n4.	Building Rapport  \n•	First impressions/introductions/threading/physiology/listening/dress sense/\n•	Spontaneous conversation\n5.	Influencing via passion (energy), humour, stories, physiology, charm, knowledge, integrity, authenticity \n6.	The big picture - Taking action to achieve success – no more bullshit\n\nSTEP ONE - Creating Awareness /the Big Picture\nPart one of my extreme Impact system is awareness. You need to be aware of yourself and who you are – I call it the truth – before we can move on and fix what needs to be fixed and what is holding you back. \nActivity - What kind of an impression do you leave? \nI want you to answer this question – take your time. Think about it. “What impression do you leave on people?” “would people remember me one year down the line?” Write it down. \n\nSHARE\nAre you happy with that impression? Increase Pain here – consequences of not taking action. Write down the consequences of not taking action. \n\nSHARE\nYou are all here because you have committed to make that change – enough is enough!!\nNow write down what kind of an impression you would like to leave. Take one right now – but the impression you want to leave will change according to your audience. For example, you will be want to leave a different impression with your boss than a friend. \n\nSHARE\n\nPleasure\nHow will your life change if you become your alter ego – make a list of all the changes. \n\nSHARE\n\nPowerful/transformational question\nWhat do you need to do/what steps do you need to take to leave that kind of impression? Write it down \nPossibilities -\n•	Be more confident\n•	Not care what others think\n•	Speak clearer\n•	Listen better\n•	More self-belief\n•	Not get intimidated by my audience\n•	Speak better English\n•	Better body language\n•	Know what to say\nWe are going to work on all this over the next 3 months. \n\nNow onto  Step 2 – Attitude\nAttitude is everything in life. What do I mean by attitude? Elicit. How many of you wish you could do anything you wanted to and not be worried about what people thought? Let’s share with each other what kind of attitude we have right now. Now let’s work on the attitude you need. Write down the attitude you need for success - Share. \nSo, we are going to work on your attitude now – making sure you have the right attitude before I work on the skills part. \n\nCreating your alter Ego \n\nData Point – it’s easier to act who you want to become – fake it till you become it\nWrite down the kind of person you want to be. Be honest and dream big. This will be a blueprint of who you want to be and we will work towards that. Once you have the self confidence, there is nothing holding you back.  Give your alter ego a name -make it powerful and real. If you called yourself hulk then you can’t  be a puny personality. \nYour alter ego is the person you want to be.  \nWrite down 5 conversations that go on in your head that hold you back in communication. \nSHARE\nPossibilities - \n•	What should I say?\n•	How should I say it?\n•	Will the other person respond?\n•	What will the other person think? \n•	Will they misunderstand me?\n•	Will I be clear?\n•	I don’t speak very good English so I can’t express myself clearly\n•	What happens if I go blank?\nWhat will happen if you don’t deal with these conversations? (intensify PAIN) How has it impacted you so far? 5 years down the line how will it affect you? You will remain invisible\nHow would you feel if you could get rid of all these conversations? AMAZING? You have to get rid of all these conversations if you want to communicate with extreme impact (power, influence, charm) and become visible from invisible. \nI am really gonna intensify the pain further and put on my Hitler cap. \n\n10.45am\nI do not believe in theory – I believe in action and solid outcomes. \nWe are going to spend the rest of the day doing some wild activities that are going to bust those destructive and irritating conversations. Are you up for the challenge? These are going to change the way you approach people and interact with them. All SET??\nYou have one hour 30 minutes to complete 3 activities - we will meet here and do a post mortem. You will work in pairs and one person will film the other. I want proof that you have done this activity. (I will deal with people who are hesitant – however, they should already have an inkling of what they are in for if they have attended my preview seminar). Prizes for those who do really well! During the 3 month course I will randomly ask them to repeat some of the activities. This is a good indicator of how far they have come in their journey with me.  \n10.45 – 11.15am Tea break\n11.15am – 12.30pm\nSTEP 2 Continued – Attitude \nData Point - Building resilience and a thick skin - Getting over what people will think of you. Being more open to initiating conversation\nActivity ONE\nTraffic Lights\n\nActivity TWO\nBe a film star\n\nActivity THREE\n\nDressing up time?\n12.30pm – 1.30pm POST MORTEM on activities 1-3\n\nGreat! How was that? How are you all feeling? SHARE. Let’s play some of what you did. I will ask them questions as I am watching the videos. What was going on in your mind? What does all this say about your state of mind \n\nWhy have I asked you to do all these activities? It’s to build your resilience to what people think of you. Your focus cannot be what people think. Your focus has to be how to achieve your call to action or influence your audience. (I can do an influence module later)  \n\nHas this reframed your thoughts? In what way has it? Are you now less hesitant to go up to people? Do you care less what people think? If yes great, if no then don’t worry -  I have plenty more activities in store for you all over the next 3 months – life will never be the same again.  \n\n\n1.30pm – 2.30pm Lunch\n\n2.30 pm – 3.30pm \n\nSTEP 4 – Building Rapport/Emoting/ (step 3 will come after this – I want them to go out raw)\n\nNow that you guys are getting good at this I am going to send you out again! This time you have to take it to step 3! You need to build rapport, emote and influence. If you feel you are not good at acting then get over it! You need to fake it or model yourself on someone – imagine being your favourite actor. Or better -  be your alter ego. I need you guys to record this so work in pairs or record the conversation. \nActivity FOUR\nBelief system – convincing people of who you know\nConvince people that you are a good friend of Amitabh Bachchan \nActivity FIVE\nShare one sob story – how to garner empathy\nActivity SIX\nPretend you are on the phone with someone and have just got the most amazing news. Show your happiness. People will come up to you and ask you what is up. (other option is you tell strangers your good news)\n3.30pm – 4pm Tea Break \n4pm – 5pm\nPost Mortem on activities 4-6 plus introducing Step 3 - Authenticity\nThey should share their experiences – what was going through their head? Was it tough? Were they able to build a connection? If not then why not? Did they change the way they connected according to the audience? Were the fears and worries they had previously still there (fear of people judging them etc) Did they find that when they played their alter ego they felt powerful and carefree?  They will get more chances over the next few days. Play the videos or voice recordings, giving tips along the way. I will look at how authentic they are and that being yourself is the key to building rapport and establishing trust.  This will be explored in detail in Day 2.\n5pm\nActivities 7 and 8\nData Point  - Changing the way you interact with those you know\nYou guys should be far more resilient now. Sometimes it’s easier opening up to a stranger as you will never see them again. But what about people you will see again and again. Would you have the same resilience with them? Let’s find out!\n5pm – 5.30pm\nActivity SEVEN\nParticipants need to come on stage one by one and sing a song of their choice. Last minute I will give them a twist \nActivity EIGHT\nThey have to come on stage and dance for 15 seconds in a way that suits the music being played. \n5.30pm – 6pm \nPost mortem on activity 7-8\nWas this tougher or easier? Explore why. Ask loads of questions so that they introspect and come up with answers. \nHow many of you have changed your conversations – reframed your thoughts? If some haven’t then don’t worry – we have lots of interesting activities lined up for tomorrow! Tomorrow we are going to look at being authentic in your delivery and establishing trust in the process.  And also building up your skills as well as strengthening your connection with your audience.  Please go through your commandments and when you go home today I want you to be your alter ego.\n\n?\nDAY 2\n9.30am – 10am\nData Point - Learning to laugh at yourself – imperfection is hilarious and builds a great rapport\nActivity NINE\nCome on stage and talk about 2 strange habits that you have or 2 things you are really bad at. For example – I am a terrible cook, in fact I am so bad that my mother in law tells me I should rest and she will do the cooking!! \n10am – 11.30am\nSTEP 3 – Authenticity – discovering your own unique delivery style\nIt is important that we are authentic in our communication. We should NOT try to sound like anyone or copy someone. We need to discover our own style and build on it. Being authentic is key to building trust with your audience. The last thing you want is for someone to say “he/she is SO fake’. Fake people only attract fake people and create mistrust. Give the diamond metaphor.\nWhat is your style right now when you interact with people? What are your strengths?\nList them down – be generous with yourself!\nData Point - Giving your delivery style energy and power and authenticity\nNow that we know your strengths – how can we leverage them?\nSHARE your strengths. Once they share them we will together figure out their delivery style.\nActivity TEN\nDiscovering your on stage delivery style \nGo on stage and talk about yourself/your childhood for 2 minutes – it is not a speech but a conversation. \nI want all of you to write down what each person’s delivery style is and then we will work at making it even better! Remember you need to be your alter ego. \nI will talk about voice modulation/ powerful voice and self-confidence connection (diaphragm/ singing/ breathing) power of practice/stress of words/clarity/projection of voice/we breathe our thought and outbreath is voice. Talk about the fact that on stage and off stage delivery should be the same.\n11.30pm - 12pm Tea Break\n12.pm – 1.30pm\nStep 3  - Authenticity and Powerful delivery continued\nActivities (eleven/twelve/thirteen/fourteen)\nFiguring out what your style of delivery/Chunking/tongue twisters/shouting words/reading out a passage that is really boring and bringing it to life\n\n1.30pm – 2.30pm LUNCH\n2.30pm – 3.30pm\nSTEP 4 continued - Rapport\nPowerful introductions and first impressions and why they are so important – the first step to building a rapport.  \nActivity FIFTEEN\nPlease go around and introduce yourself in not more than 20 seconds. \nGet feedback. SHARE. \nRE do and give your introductions again with the inputs given. Everyone will in groups come up with a kick ass wow introduction. \n3.30pm – 4.30pm\nThreading - Art of Conversation – how to never run out of things to say\nData Point - building a rapport and a lasting relationship with anyone, anywhere.  How to start, continue and end a conversation. \nActivity SIXTEEN Role Play (40 minutes) bring in the 3 cs at some point\nHow many of you initiate a conversation?\nSHARE – those who do and those who do not. Why is it important? You should be in a position where you can add value to a conversation and lead it and control the direction it takes. In fact, I want you to be able to go up to anyone and have the confidence and skill to hold a conversation. \nRemember small details about a conversation and the person you are talking to. Bring it up in the next conversation. It is very endearing. Give an example of threading. If you have nothing to say, ask lots of questions. Learn to listen. Very important skill that is not used by many -give Stephen Covey  quote on listening. Active listening – listening without the intent to respond. \nScenario\nYou are waiting for a flight which has been delayed. You strike up a conversation with people on the same flight. \nYou are given a chit and in that you are assigned a profession – plumber/carpenter/astronaut/politician/stripper/bookie/mafia/builder/lawyer/banker/teacher/detective/ coach/chef/dancer/bouncer/bodyguard/assassin/porn star/\nYou need to talk to all of the participants.   You have 2 minutes with each person to build a rapport and make an impact. Try to use humour. Focus on body language and open ended questions – really engage with other person. Also don’t jump to assumptions.\n4.30pm – 4.45pm TEA\n4.45pm – 5.45pm\nActivity SEVENTEEN\nData Point – making conversation in a professional setting. Again use threading. \nScenario – participants are at a conference on stress management and start chatting over a tea break. I will chip in and give inputs while they are talking on - \n•	what is appropriate and what is not\n•	how to include everyone in a conversation\n•	how to change the topic\n•	why it is important to watch your audience\n•	when their state changes and how to deal with that\n•	how to end a conversation with the intention never to see the person again\n•	how to end the conversation but not the door\n•	asking smart questions and not stupid ones \n•	maintaining the flow by listening\n\n5.45pm - 6pm\nI will round up the day with questions and answers and encourage them to return for day 3!! They need to come to Day 3 with a funny joke which they will tell us. They should talk to a stranger for at least 3 minutes. \n\n\n\n\n\n?\nDay 3\nSTEP 4 – Spontaneous Conversation\n9am – 9.30am\nSHARE your conversation experience with a stranger. This is spontaneous – something I want to explore today. Most of our conversations are spontaneous – on the spot and zero preparation time. How many of you struggle with that? We have tackled the worrying what others will say. Our fear of spontaneous conversation deters us from initiating conversation or even answering someone properly. \n(Tell us your joke on stage throughout the day – I will pick them throughout the day when I feel I need a state change. They will randomly stand up and share their joke. Best joke gets a chocolate). \n9.30am – 10.30am\nData Point – bringing energy to your delivery and on the stop talking\n\nActivity EIGHTEEN \n\nBollywood/Hollywood  \nBring your topic to life. Immediately come on stage. While on stage I will give them a character to play (opposite to their own character. If they are quiet I will ask them to be Ranveer Singh x 100 -  exaggerated 100 times)– they have 15 seconds to get into character and I will give them a boring topic (chair/grass/leaves etc) and they have to talk about it for 1 minute. \n\n10.15am – 10.45am \n\nActivity NINETEEN\n\nSpontaneous conversation \n\nData point – on the spot thinking, bringing energy to your delivery, free thinking, mindfulness\n\nMaking a story from random words  that either I or they give each other. They have to come up with a crazy story.\n\n10.45am – 11.15am\n\nData Point – sharpening  your recall skills\n\nActivity TWENTY\nFinding alternative words from a given list so that you sharpen your recall skills  - good for those who tend to go blank or have problems finding the right word. \n11.15 – 11.45am TEA\n11.45am – 1pm\nSTEP 5 – Influencing\nThe Art of Storytelling (is this a step)\nData Point – Listening skills and speaking in the flow of the conversation/in context.\nActivity TWENTY ONE (20 mins)\nBest way to influence is always subtle. Tell a story but each participant says only one sentence and so is forced to listen to the participants before. I will randomly choose who speaks next so that they are forced to listen and think on the spot as they don’t know when their turn will come. Great for listening and focussing and speaking in context. They will most likely come up with really boring stuff – it has to be wild. Let your thoughts flow, do not hold back. This is when we get our best ideas. \nData Point – spinning a great story – using words and actions\nActivity TWENTY TWO (60 mins)\nTelling a great story\nThe importance of telling stories – why we have to perfect the art. \nI will give them tips on good story telling (shouldn’t be too long, you have to feel it and that will come through in your body language and verbally, what details to keep and what not to keep)\nThey have to think of a great story about themselves. Using all the tips they have learnt, they have to come on stage and share their story (not more than a few minutes). We vote (silent vote) on how effective it was and whether the audience could relate to it and if they found it interesting. \nWith the inputs they have to say it again. \nThere will hopefully be a great improvement second time round – they should be more comfortable on stage and relaxed. \n1pm – 1.15pm\nActivity TWENTY THREE\nMad African tribal dance- state change \nCrazy dancing for a minute \n1.15pm – 2.15pm LUNCH\n\n2.15pm – 3pm EMOTING/shedding inhibitions\n\nData point for activity 24 and 25– getting over your inhibitions and communicating through your body language. \n\nActivity TWENTY FOUR – Charlie Chaplin (40 minutes)\n\nThey have to emote through their body only, ie their physiology – the way these personalities move/emote/dance. I will give them famous personalities that have very unique body language.  They get 30 seconds to nail it. Examples of personalities would be Salman Khan, Shar Rukh khan, Mithun Chakravaty, Govinda, Amitabh Bachchan, Madhuri Dixit, Ashwarya Rai,  Aamir khan, Sanjay Dutt,    Hritik Roshan, Rajnikant, Malaika Arora,    Helen. Will get some of the guys to do the lady dancers!\n\n3pm – 3.45pm\n\nActivity TWENTY FIVE\n\nEmoting\nThey are given a few chits which have an adjective on them ranging from flirty, serious, nervous, angry, victim mode, love struck, arrogant, awkward, irritable, bad listener, weepy etc. They have to be like that in conversation with each participant. The participant has to guess and write down what character trait the person is.  After they get 2 other participants to guess the trait correctly they then go onto the next trait with another participant. Each chit will have 4 traits which they have to do.  The first to finish gets a chocolate. I will aim to give them traits that are alien to them. \n\n3.45pm – 4.45pm\n\nPutting your 5 steps together\n\nActivity TWENTY SIX  \n\nAn activity where you are given a task where you have a call to action – you will use everything that you have learnt over the last 3 days.\nIF you are successful in this activity then you should get an invitation to dine at a stranger’s house!\n4.45pm – 5.15pm TEA BREAK\n5.15pm – 6pm\n\nSTEP 7 – You are worth it – the ultimate test of influence and impact\nActivity TWENTY FOUR\nBecause I am Worth it  \nData point – Self Confidence\nSelling yourself through your belief system \nPreparation – 10 minutes. Use all that you have been taught. First impressions, building a rapport, \nScenario\nMock interview where you have to get the job!\nThis is a great exercise because we generally focus on what we are not good at, what we lack. This activity will make us realise how amazing we are as well as how we have to tailor our thoughts and conversation according to the action required. \n6pm – 6.30pm\nContinuing the Journey \nThe importance of incorporating what you have learnt. How will it change your life? How will it change your interactions? Be specific – I want you to think about this and share it. \n6.30 – 7pm\nWhat Next? Continuing the journey\nAn action plan from participants on how they will now change the way they communicate in all areas of life. They have to write down a list of 30 activities they will do that will challenge them – this will be a group activity – they will have a master list of which they can choose 20. These will be carried out during the next 3 months. You will choose a buddy and be accountable to each other. I will set them one major activity a week such as preparing an inspirational story and sharing it in a group of at least 5 acquaintances. Or going up to 5 strangers in one day and making conversation. \n\nThroughout the 3 day program I will focus on authenticity and outward focus and consequences of not taking action and consequence of taking action – the big picture – Now and later. These are key to being impactful and powerful communicators. \n\nAdditional one day workshop – given as a bonus\n\n•	Influence – using pathos/ethos/logos. \nTopic to be discussed in 2 Buddy Meets/Webinars (4 total)\n•	Criticism and how to handle it  and how to give it so that you get your call to action\n•	Reframing your thoughts - Powerful questions and how they can flip any conversation both internal and external  conversations\n•	Creating a great environment through your communication\n•	Writing a great obituary\n\nStructure of Program 8th September - 7th December\nWeek 1 	3 day 8/9/10 September\nWeek 1 to 2 	one to one power session (a bonus)\nWeek 3	Buddy Meet 4th October September \nWeek  6	Webinar 24th October\nWeek 8	Bonus day on Influence Nov 4th\nWeek 10 	Webinar 21st Nov\nWeek 13 	Buddy Meet 7th December\n', 0),

Although one thing that i could not get away from was the guilt inside me that made me feel so ridiculous about myself. I did decide to become a better person and slowly started improving myself but for years i failed to get out of the guilt, i always that i didn\'t value myself enough until one day someone made me realise that the reason i felt so bad about the entire thing was cause i value myself and expected to do better than what i did, someone who had no value wouldn\'t even regret it. It was a life changing realisation for me and thats how this journey Began for me…\n\nThe first point covered here will be the ability to make decisions.(it will automatically work on fear about failures as when you decide to make a decision you defeat your fear of getting failed)\nOne of the most important part of doing anything in our life is to first make the decision to do that whatever it is that we want to do. Even if we don\'t choose to make them, they are still always made for us. However its always better to make them ourselves.If we look back at our life right now there are definitely decisions that have impacted our life to a very great extent, one decision about career or marriage or that one decision to attend seminar or reading a book.\n\nWhat determines our quality of life is the decisions we make. The part thats makes making decisions the easiest thing to do is that its an ability we already possess. Although making a decision is something to be absolutely committed to it. Its different then simply wishing to do something. Making a decision is setting standards for ourselves to what we will accept in life, when we don\'t have these standards set for us, its easy to fall into behaviours below these standards. decisions help to change any aspect of our life, all that is needed is to decide standards we expect in our life and stick to them no matter whats happens. Making a decision is about absolute commitment and leaving no other possibility.  Whatever our life is today and all the challenges that are in front of us could have been avoided if better decisions were made.\n\nSteps to make use of the ability to make decisions:\n\n\n1- To always remember its one of the greatest abilities we have, making decisions is a realisation that we can choose, we have the power of CHOICE. We don\'t have to live our life the way it happens. We can make a different decision and choose how we want live our lives.\n\n2- COMMITMENT- The hardest thing is not commitment but deciding something in the first place.Take a decision quickly without thinking about the “hows” to achieve it. Rapid decisions should be the ones based on our true values and than commitment will follow \n\n3- Make more and more decisions - The more decisions you will make, the better you will become at making them. Utilise the power and it\'ll bring massive energy in your life.\n\n4-Learn- No matter how much we try we will make some wrong decisions, its inevitable. There was always a lesson in everything. You should always focus on what you can learn from the experience and use it to make better decisions in future.\n\n5-Consistency- Continue new and better ways till you achieve what you want!\n\nEXERCISE \n\nA. Write down 3 things about your life that u want to change today.\n\nB. Write down what actions/decisions u need to make to change these 3 things.\n\nC. Make at least 1 decision today based on ur inner values or instincts.\n\n-WORKING ON INSECURITIES\n\nThe focus will be on awareness and acceptance and making decisions. We get out of life only what we put in it. No one has power over us, except “we”.We all have rigid rules about life that we have learnt from childhood, we learn how to feel about ourselves by people around us. No one is to be blamed over here, everyone is doing the best they can do with the level of awareness and knowledge they have. All are victims of victims.We choose our own thoughts. Its possible to change attitude towards past. The moment you ask yourself, “How do i value myself?” - you have already begun the process.\n\nExercise \n\nFirst write down some problems that you have been experiencing in your life.. make a small list\nSecond make a small sentence of each problem and add the words “Because” after each sentence \nThird read this sentence aloud now and write down as many things as come to your mind after each sentence. Keep the judgement aside and just complete it in as many ways as you can without stopping. Now you can pick the wheat from the chaff, the answers to because will be most often our basic mind chatter which will show the limiting beliefs.\n\nExercise\nAsking to write \nI SHOULD\n___________________________________\n___________________________________\n___________________________________\n___________________________________\n___________________________________\n\n5/6 ways to finish these sentences— answer why to each of the sentences(to find the beliefs, cause most of the reasons are that someone else said they should do it) \nNext reframe the sentences with “if i could, I would________”  Next is  “why haven\'t you?” — the answers to this will be the real “awareness” \n\n(There are 2 exercises and i don\'t know which one is better so I\'ve written down both of them.)\n\nSTEP 1 (Awareness)\n-	Finding things on the “should” list that can be dropped with a sense of relief .\n-	the point is there is a realisation by the end that most of the things we “should do”are just there cause someone else said we should do them and we belittle ourselves cause of standards that others have set for us .. by the end of this there will be certain things on the list that will be dropped with a sense of relief.\n\n\nExercise 2 \n\nParticipants will find partners and take things from the list they want to change and look into the other persons’s eyes and say “ I now realise that i have created this condition and i am now willing to release the pattern of consciousness that is responsible for this condition”, the partner will tell if he/she thinks you really meant it.\n\nthe point is accepting, you really don\'t need to know the hows. the subconscious mind will figure out the hows.with every word you tell your mind and it believes it. the power is in the thoughts.- STEP 2 (Acceptance)\n\nThe first exercise will help in identifying insecurities, i had grown up being an insecure person and have an elder brother who i am extremely close with. I always felt that he was loved more by my parents than me, although i know it was all just in my mind but i always felt that way. This started continuing with my friends as i always got scared if i’d be replaced by someone else and than also continued when my brother got married and i felt my sister in law has now taken my place in my brothers life. I went miserable and i started fighting with everyone and kept thinking low of myself. It had made my life which was really fine into a mess cause of my insecurities. But it was at this time that i realised i had to work on it.. The solution first came with a realisation (awareness)that what i was feeling didn’t really exist. It was just a feeling, it was my insecurity and not a reality.. The second step was the importance of uniqueness, no one can tell us how good or bad we are and we are our own competition. Everyone has a different story in life and its unique in its own way.  is that it completely vanished? Did i never ever get that feeling again ? No! Its a journey, it starts with awareness and its a journey that one goes on..\n\n-	Life is simple, we get what we give, they are just our beliefs, past is gone and power is only in the present moment and change can begin from now..\n\nList down things from above that you\'d like to and can take an immediate action on, take a decision today to work on now thing from the list above.\n\nExercise 3 \nMirror exercise \nLooking at yourself in your eyes and telling “I LOVE YOU’\n\nExercise 4\nFinding out how to feel good, write down a list of things that you can currently do to feel good\nFind out at least 15 things\nfor example if i am in a bad mood - taking a Nice shower, watching an online video of stand up comedy, dancing, playing with kids, going for a spa- these are the things that get me instantly in a good mood.\n\nCONCEPT OF REALITY \n\nOne very important part that helped me while working nonbeing insecure was the realisation i got when i asked for help was that whatever i felt was just a feeling inside me and not the truth, it wasn\'t anything real, in reality all of us have different stories and no-one can ever replace anyone. We are our only competition, only we can tell ourselves how good to bad we are, since everyone has a unique journey in life.\n\nAsking Empowering Questions \n\nWe are always having an internal conversation.. how we feel about ourselves are just our thoughts, thoughts are determined by the questions and answers we have in our mind. YOU RECEIVE WHAT YOU ASK. People generally ask themselves terrible questions and receive terrible answers. What determines the quality of our life is meaning we attach to our experiences and the meaning depends on the questions we ask ourselves when we experience an event.\nEveryone has certain habitual questions they keep asking themselves..\n\nQuality questions lead to a quality life. Its not just the questions people ask but also the questions that they fail to ask that leads to the quality of life they live.\n\n\n-	Questions determine what we FOCUS on. If you keep asking yourself “ why nobody loves me?” “why do people always walk over me” you will focus on past experiences and find pointless reasons for same. However if you ask yourself question like “what can i do to feel more happy and being more loveable ?” , you’ll focus on getting solutions. Although initially you may get answers like “theres nothing i can do” you will eventually find reasons to feel better and you will find answers that you deserve.\n-	QUESTIONS give us REASONS- if you keep asking questions like “ What could i be happy about? “ “what am i happy about now? “ “how will that make me feel?” You will find reasons be happy. \n\n-	Questions change the resources available to us - Asking empowering questions leads us in the direction of finding the answers that are already within us but we don\'t reach. the kind of questions we ask change the perception of who we are and what we are willing To do.\n\nEXERCISE\n\nyou ask yourself right now, “what are you truly happy about in your life Right now?” “what are you truly grateful for?”. Write down the answers to this and see how it makes you feel.\n\nASK PROBLEM SOLVING QUESTIONS-\n\nThe point is now to develop a pattern of questions to ask overtime in a challenging situation.There is no question about whether we will face problems, the question is how to deal with them when they arise. Here are 5 questions to ask when facing a challenge next time to get solutions \n\n1- Whats great about this problem?\nInitially the answer is “nothing” but upon digging deeper in this question, we always find something thats great in every problem\n\n2-What is not perfect yet ?\nasking this question clearly implies that things Will eventually be perfect\n\n3-What am i willing to do to make it the way i want it?\nThis question will immediately lead to finding solutions to the challenge\n\n4- What am i willing to no longer do to make it the way i want it ?\nthis will help to get out of the victim zone of crying about problems and complaining \n\n5- How can i enjoy this process?\nThis is last but most important question that helps in making the journey enjoyable and more fun..\n\nVOCABULARY \n\nThe words we choose regularly affects the communication we have with ourselves and thus it also affects what we experience.\nWe can instantly change our emotional experience by choosing new words to describe to our own selves how we are feeling. If we fail to take control of the words we use and allow the selection to be unconscious, we maybe changing the meaning of an entire experience.\nThe challenge is not the size of vocabulary we consciously understand but the words we choose.\nfor eg- if you use the word “hate” for- “i hate my hair” “i hate having to study”, it increases the emotional intensity of the experience than if you would have used “ i prefer something else”\nJust by changing the habitual vocabulary we use , the words we use to describe our emotional states we can instantly change how we feel about it and what we experience \nIf there are words that disempower you, replace them with new words.\nChanging the vocabulary helps to break patterns and also helps to ask more intelligent questions.\n\nFor example\nFailure- learning\nHate- i prefer\nIrritated- stimulated\nRejected- misunderstood\n\n\nEXERCISE \nThink of 3 words habitually that create negative feelings and find alternatives for them \nDisempowering word                                    Empowering word\n______________________                          ______________________\n______________________                          ______________________\n______________________                          ______________________\n\n3 Steps to do this \n\n1- Decide to get committed to use these words and want to feel empowered and not disempowered. Realise how the words intensify your negative emotions\n\n2- Think how ridiculous it is to keep feeling bad when you can have the choice of feeling good. go to a friend and use the new alternate words that you have decided\n\n3- for the next 10 days if you catch yourself using the old word, immediately break the pattern and replace it with new word.\n\nAt the end of the day they will be given assignments to do every day:\n\n3 Compliments journal- waking up in the morning and giving 3 compliments to oneself.. can be extremely small.\n\n-Making decisions weekly and achieving them which will help them build confidence.\n\n-Getting up every day and telling yourself in the mirror “I APPROVE OF MYSELF”\n\n-THE BELIEF BOOK-Over this period of 1 month write down all the beliefs you have about yourself through monitoring your self-talk in this book\n\n--participants will be give a journal - THE DECISION MAKER-where they will write down 1 decision every week that they make.\n\n\nParticipants will be paired in 2.. so that they stay accountable to each other and work on the above things consistently as they will be accountable to each other.\n\nMONTH 2 \n1 Day Workshop\n\nBuilding a new YOU- STEP 3 \n\nWe are always taught to fight the negatives in us thinking that if we do so, he positive will automatically come to us, but the fact lies in WHAT WE PAY ATTENTION TO GROWS. There is no benefit in fighting the negatives you don\'t want. The things you dislike about yourself are still with you.\n\nExercise 1 \nYesterday Today and Tomorrow\n\nNext to each of these categories give yourself a score from 0 to 10, where 0 means you\'ve done absolutely nothing in this area and 10 means you\'re doing your best. in the next column write a sentence to describe what you were like then.\n\nFive Years ago         Score      Sentence \n\nPhysically\n\nMentally \n\nEmotionally\n\nRelationships \n\nSocially \n\nSpiritually\n\nCareer. \n\nNow lets see how far you\'ve come or failed to come in each of these categories. Answer same questions based on today\n\nToday         Score      Sentence \n\nPhysically\n\nMentally \n\nEmotionally\n\nRelationships\n \nSocially \n\nSpiritually\n\nCareer.\n\nHave you improved in any of the areas ? how far have you come? Doesn\'t it feel great ? if you haven\'t come far or made any progress its a great message- it can be drive for the coming years.

Each meet will be of around 2 hrs duration.\n\nC.	6 conference calls - There will be a conference call every month which will cover questions from different participants. All other can benefit from these questions also. \nThe duration will be around 1-2 hrs.\n\n\n3 days extensive workshop will cover the following 6 data points –\n\n1.	Awareness of the actual problem\n\nPeople must become aware of the actual problem because of which the situation has gone bad. The outcome of this step is to let people know that you have the solution with you. It’s only that you need to understand that once you understand the real causes of the problem and start changing yourself, the problems are going to be solved.\n\nThis will include a questionnaire asking what you think who (wife, husband or both) is responsible for the current state of their relationship. \nThen there will be a class share to let everyone know what people generally think.\n\nIt will include the story of a friend who used to think that all the problems are there with his wife. If she changes, the problems will be solved. However after questioning him for 10-15 minutes, he somehow realized that the problem is at both the ends. If I start changing the things at my end, situation is going to improve.\n\nPeople who think their spouse creates problems, will ask a series of questions to 2-3 such participants and will try to make them realize that the problems is at both ends and the person should start changing himself start to improve the situation.\n\nThe outcome of this data point will be that people will realize the importance of changing themselves to solve their relationship problems.\n\nThe total duration for this data point will be around 1.5-2 hrs.\n\n2.	 Perception \n\nThis is the most important step as most of the problems will be solved by changing your perception. The way you look at people, situations, circumstances will change once you change your perception.\n\nIt will include an activity related to perspective positioning to make them see from others point of view. It will be followed by class share.\n\nIt will include another activity which shows how people see things from different points of view and how does it affect them.\n\nIt will include a questionnaire which will help them introspect their perception and how is that perception making them weak or strong and what other believable perception they can think of which will solve the problem. It will be followed by class share.\n\nIt will have 2-3 stories which will show how by just changing your perception towards a situation or circumstance, the problem gets solved very easily.\n\nI will invite 2-3 participants and ask their problems and will directly relate their problems to the perception they have which creates problems. And will let them know how by changing their perception, they can easily solve the problem. These will be the real time breakthroughs.\n\nThere will be some written material also related to perception which will help them understand the importance of perception.\n\nThe outcome of this data point will be that the importance of accepting somebody else’s point of view will become clearly to the participants. They will understand how important is it to understand other’s perception and change your perception accordingly to avoid conflicts.\n\nThe total duration for this data point would be around 6-7 hours.\n\n3.	Learn to forgive and forget\n\nForgiveness is another very important step which makes sure that people do not cling to their past. It is generally observed that whenever any argument is initiated, people tend to include past incidents in the current argument which makes the situation worse. This happens because they keep on repeating the same incident in their mind again and again. Therefore it’s very important to forgive somebody to come out of the past.\n\nIt will include an activity of writing affirmations to forgive people.\n\nIt will include another activity of hypnosis using progressive relaxation \n\nIt will include 2-3 stories where people had made their life mess because they were clinging on to the past and not able to forgive people and how by using these techniques they could forgive others and felt relieved.\n\nThe outcome of this data point will be that people will understand the importance of forgiving others so that they can offload the baggage they carry with them and feel relieved. Also they will not have any hard feelings for the spouse after practicing forgiveness. \n\nThe total duration for this data point would be around 2-3 hours.\n\n\n\n\n4.	Understand  your partner’s definition of love\n\nUnderstanding what makes your partner feel loved is one of the important steps in making the relationship better.\n\nIt will include a questionnaire which will ask them about what makes their partner feel extremely happy and help people understand what makes their partner feel loved. \nIt will be followed by class share.\n\nIt will include an activity where couple will be called on stage and few questions will be asked to husband related to wife’s likings and disliking and vice versa. \n\nIt will have 2-3 stories which will show that you are trying to show love by doing few specific things, however those things are secondary for your partner. You are not even aware of the things that make your partner feel happy and loved.\n\nThe outcome of this data point will be that people will understand the importance of knowing their partner’s definition of love and they can love their partner the way they want. This is like giving the partner what they want from you.\n\nThe total duration for this data point would be around 3-4 hours\n\n\n5.	Avoid blame game\n\nOften people tend to blame their spouse if something goes wrong. A language of blame game never helps; instead it makes the relation bitter with time. Even if the person has done a mistake because of which the problem has occurred, then there are better ways to communicate the same instead of blaming.\n\nThere will be written material on how to avoid using a blaming language and use the correct suggestive language to avoid the same things in future. \n\nWill share 2-3 different scenarios ( like child not showing disciplined behaviour or got less marks in exams)  where people generally use the blaming language against the spouse  and ask 2-3 different participants how does it affects them. \n\nIt will have 2-3 stories which will show them the importance of using a suggestive language instead of using a blaming one.\n\nThe outcome of this data point will be that people will understand the importance of using correct language while communicating with their partner which will definitely help in reducing the conflicts.\n\nThe total duration for this data point would be around 2-3 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.	Avoid assumptions, start good communication\n\nPeople often assume instead of clarifying whatever they assumed is right or not. \nSuch assumptions generally create misunderstanding between the couple which leads to conflicts. Best way to avoid such misunderstanding is to stop assuming anything and start communicating well with the partner. \n\nIt will include 2-3 real life stories stating how assumptions creates deeper misunderstanding between the couples , but how effective communication clears all the misunderstanding and hence avoids the conflicts.\n\nWill ask 2-3 people from the audience about how assumptions had created misunderstanding in the relationship and what they can do in such scenarios to avoid it from now on.\n\nThe outcome of this data point will be that people will people will understand the importance of effective communication and how assumptions leads to misunderstanding and conflicts.\n\n	The total duration for this data point would be around 2-3 hours\n\n\n\nBonuses will include-\n\nOne to one meeting of an hour\n\nOne personal phone call of an hour\n\nFacebook group for all the participants where they can ask their queries and I along with other participants will answer their query.\n', 0),

The first part is where through various activities we get to know their past and patterns of behaviour. This is the base for our next step. In most cases it makes the participants aware of what events of the past are still influencing their present. We also close certain events where there was no closure through different activities.\r\nB.	The second part is where they understand what drives them to do what they do (Pain/Pleasure linkage) and how can they be aware of their thoughts (Hulk and Barbie – Venn Diagram of thoughts)\r\nC.	An activity and series of questions to understand which area of their life requires attention, what could be the possible triggers and what language of thought should they be changing.\r\nD.	Then a kick ass activity to explain affirmations and how can they be used in daily life. We call it a Thought Tracker and its also a part of the bonus.\r\nE.	What is the code. The crux. Explaining how our experiences and belief systems shape us and our behaviour. Also, awareness of Maslow’s need hierarchy through visuals, videos and activities.

My name is Naina and I am going to get you fit. \n\n3.2	My Story/ ETR\nI wasn’t always fit and confident, in fact I used to be weak, I had low self-esteem and I struggled with fitting in. Growing up in a boarding school can be lonely, but having no friends and no sense of belongings is just the worse. Everyone picked on me and I used to be total social outcast. It was really tough.\n\nOne day my house captain woke me up at 5am and said to me “Wake up, you need to run a cross-country marathon as we are short of runners.” My answer to that was Hell No! Then she provided me with an offer I couldn’t refuse. She said to me either run or your going to get detention for lack of team spirit and before I could even take it all in I was running.   \n\nI didn’t run with my heart, I was so sleepy and I was hating it, but it slowly all changed as I kept going. It all changed as I watched the sun come up from between the mountains, it was so beautiful I never wanted to stop and then I never did.  I trained alone, I just ran and coaches started to notice that and became interested in training me. From then on I went to represent the school, the district, the city and the state. I had a sense of belongingness. My identity was discovered on the tracks and it was an invincible one. The endurance I built from running helped me in other sports as well, I was a basketball and throw-ball champion at the district level and played football for the State of Maharashtra for two years. No bully, no mean girl could ever touch me again, they would call me names and say I was ugly and stupid and no one could like me, but guess what in college I got noticed by Nike and they liked me.  I am now an amateur Nike athlete and have been associated with them for 6 amazing years. I pace for the Nike Run Club and with them so far with the run club alone I’ve run over 40, 805kms. I have modeled for many Nike campaigns and was recently featured in the first ever Nike commercial that was made in India called “Da Da Ding.” \n\n3.3	The Basic Breakup of the Three Month Program is follows: \nA.	Self Awareness \nB.	Detox\nC.	Diet \nD.	Workout \n\n\n3.4	The detailed layout:\n\nA.	Self Awareness- Day 1 [Month 1]\nTo begin a journey of such significance and in this case, potentially life altering will be so much easier and meaningful with some introspection and self-awareness.  In my case, without even fully realizing it I had a few mental bocks about getting fit. Once I was made aware of them I gained the ability to breakthrough them. But step one was knowing that I had them.\n\nHere are a few questions that you must answer in writing that will make you more aware of yourself.\n\nQ1- Write down three beliefs that you have about loosing weight. For example do you find it hard, easy or boring to loose weight or workout?\n \nQ2- Write down five reasons as to why you haven’t lost weight yet. And for those of you who have lost weight in the past, write down why you think you put the weight back on?\n\nQ3-Fill out the following questionnaire\n•	Name\n•	Contact details \n•	Emergency Contact\n•	Current Weight\n•	Injuries you have\n•	Do you drink alcohol, if yes how often.\n•	Your current workout regime \n•	Your current diet: what do you eat for breakfast, lunch and dinner. \n\nHow many of you think that it is difficult and boring to workout? I am going to prove to you right now that it is easy and fun to workout with the help of a game. \nThe game is called Brides Wars I need three to be brides to step in the front. Once three women step forward, I bring them imagine a beautiful limited edition Vera Wang dress that is the last of its kind and all three brides know that this dress is the one. The detailing on the dress is so perfect and beautiful that it just takes your breath away. You are all approaching the dress and your gaze is fixed on that dress alone until you each realize that you are not alone in your desire to have that dress there are two other women approaching it. One of you run and just about manage to grab the dress, but the other two ladies are not going to give up on that gorgeous dress so they chase her to grab the dress off her. The three women are now running for about 10 minutes, one trying to save the dress and the other two trying to get the dress. \nThe outcome of this game is simple, when you are motivated enough you will find the will to do anything you set your mind to. With all the childlike running around we also know that working out is fun and so effortless.   \n\nWe could also play a second game called the Outrageous Bachelorette Dance off. In this game two to-be brides go up against each other on an outrageous and I mean ridiculously outrageous dance off. The winner is picked by the audience and the winner receives a cool “Badass Bride to Be” T- shirt. The outcome of this game is to also realize that its fun and easy to get moving. \n\n \nB.	Detox [Month 1] \na)	Step one of the program is to cleanse yourself internally. Your body and mind must slowly be made ready to make a lifestyle change. I call this a lifestyle change because the aspiration to be fit should not be a phase in your life. It should be a big part of your life. The detox is a two-fold process, where we have the body detox and the mind detox. \n\nb)	The Body Detox:\nYou will be required to do the following, each day for 14 days:\n\n1.	One glass of hot water with lemon before brushing. Cannot eat or drink anything after consuming this for 20 mins. \n\n2.	Freshly squeezed orange juice.\n\n3.	Fruits can only be eaten in the morning with breakfast.  \n\n4.	Only boiled food to be consumed for the entire 14 days duration. You may also eat raw vegetables. Food needs to be near bland. You may have a tiny bit of salt with each meal and black pepper.\n\n5.	No sugar in tea or coffee or ever. Replace that with honey. No milk in tea or coffee, Kiss dairy goodbye.\n\n6.	Fresh homemade soups may be consumed anytime during the day.   \n\n7.	Drink three liters of water everyday. \n\n8.	Kiss the beer and any alcoholic beverage, aerated drinks goodbye for the whole three month program.  \n\n9.	DO NOT STARVE YOURSELF. Just have boiled veges anytime you get hungry. \n\nOutcome- your body will be rid of toxins, the workouts will have a quicker and better result on the body, your skin and hair will improve. \n\nc)	The Mind Detox:\nThe body and mind detox go hand in hand. In the Mind detox segment you will learn to free yourself from thoughts that will hold you back from becoming the best version of yourself. The outcome is to become a fit, confident and a secured person. The task therefore is to reset the mind into believing that you are capable of achieving the desired results. The tool used to get to the desired results are Power Codes.\n\nThe Power of Power Codes:\nPower Codes are affirmations / commandments that you say to yourself to reset your mind. These codes are personal and powerful and should be realized with immense belief. Say these codes to yourself as often as you can. Feel the words, say them to yourself during the workout, when you wake up in the morning, before bed, etc. make a conscience effort to remember them until they are embedded in your mind and it becomes a part of you. When you say something to yourself often and over and over again it becomes your truth. It becomes a part of you. \n\n \n\nPOWER CODES OF A FIT AND CONFIDENT WOMAN\n1.	Success is my only option.\n2.	Workout is fun.\n3.	It is easy to loose weight.\n4.	Transformation is easy for me to create.\n5.	I am unstoppable, secure, powerful and confident.\n6.	Being healthy is a part of my lifestyle.\n7.	The state of my body reflects the standard and quality of my life.\n8.	I am consistent and I can make time each day to workout.\n9.	Each day I get closer to my goal.\n10.	I am driven, self-motivated and a go getter. \n\n\nManicure Meets \nOn day 20 we have our first Manicure Meet where I treat the ladies to a elegant and high end manicure where we discuss their progress. It is a great way for me to see how the detox plan has worked. Some women will be able to see significant results and some may not. It will allow me to customize the second phase of the Bride Boot Camp for them, which is their respective diet plan and workout. Every body is different and while the basic plan stays the same, so details may have to be altered based on body type. \n\nC.	Diet [Month 2 and Month 3]\nFrom day 21 of the Bride Boot Camp begins the diet and the workout. \nSo the diet and workout goes hand in hand. This is what the women will be required to eat while they are doing my workout. \n \nBreakfast \n1.	Three boiled eggs- egg whites only. \n2.	Oats with honey and hot water- you may add almonds and walnuts to this.  \n3.	Bowl of berries- strawberry, blueberry, raspberry and seasonal fruit.\n\nMorning Snack \n1.	Walnuts, pistachio, almonds and peanuts.\n2.	Berries. \n3.	Rice cakes with peanut butter (only if very hungry).\n\nLunch\n1.	Steamed fish, with a portion of brown rice.\n2.	Salad- rockets, sprouts, one boiled egg white, olives, sundried tomatoes, cucumber, boiled carrots, pepper, minimum salt, chia seeds, sea weed.\n\nNoon Snack\n1.	Walnuts, pistachio, almonds and peanuts.\n2.	Boiled vegetables and soup\n\nDinner\n1.	Grilled chicken or fish. No rice/roti.\n2.	Salad and Soup.\n\nDrink three liters of water through out the day.\nI am reading up on an effective pure vegetarian diet, I do have an idea but I will put together an effective plan for the vegetarians shortly.\n\n\nD.	Workout [Month 2 and 3] \n\n1.	“Dance the Donuts Away” or “Shake it off”\nThe first 15 days of the Boot Camp is intense cardio. This workout regime is called “Dance the Donuts Away” or “Shake it off”. \nIn these 15 days our goal is to burn 1000 calories a day.  We workout twice a day and burn 500 calories in the morning and 500 calories in the evening. \n\nThe workout here includes beach run with music, NTC and Dancing! The first few days of the workout have to be super fun so the ladies are engaged and happy. \n\n\n2.	“Super Bride”\nThis workout is strengthening focused. The work on the body will be done to make the body strong. Back strengthening exercises, knee exercises and abs will be done to make the body strong so when the workout gets intense the probability of an injury is minimized. \n\n3.	“The Bride Booty Camp”\nExercised for the lower back and legs. Combination of squats, bridges,  planks etc. To help women get toned and a hot body. \n\n\nThe Burn Book \nEach bride to be will be given a journal which looks something like this:\n\nThe Burn Book\nMonday!\n?	Workout done:\n?	Duration of Workout:\n?	Calories Burnt: 	How did you feel about your workout? \nTuesday!\n….\n	\nThe burn book documents calories burnt per day. It makes the ladies more aware and will also enable me to check their progress. \n', 0),

And each of them is designed to improve the quality and speed of your decisions.\r\nAdditionally you will have 8 assignments to submit. Again, each assignment adds on a new level of competency in your decision making.\r\nYou will get access to 7 action guides. These are meant to support you during the 3 months and act as steady reminders that you have work to do.\r\nYou will get 4 conference calls, in which I will come live and share learnings pertaining to that particular step.\r\nYou will get invited to 4 meet ups, during which we will meet at a central part of the city, and I will share some information that will bring about transformation, we will play games that will reinforce your learning.\r\n\r\nSo thats the entire system that you will get access to. \r\n\r\nNow normally I price this system at 90,000. But thats not the price today. Im giving it away at a crazy discount. Its a truly ridiculous price. And ill tell you the price after I tell you the bonuses I’m giving away completely free.\r\n\r\nSo for 90,000, which is not 90,000 today you get my complete 3 month system, and, you get:\r\n\r\nMy audio program worth 20,000 free.\r\nMy video program worth 20,000 free.\r\nA free copy of my book worth 800.\r\nAccess to a membership site- now what is a membership site? It is an online portal into which only a select few are allowed to enter. This group of people are committed to other’s development as much as they are to their own. In fact, one of the criteria to be a part of this membership site is that you have to demonstrate your commitment to improve others. \r\nNow, why do people pay lakhs and lakhs of rupees to clubs like Cricket club, Bowring institute, Bangalore club of Golf club? Is it for the food? NO! Its for the networking, its for the business opportunities. Its for the opportunity to get like minded people and do something to make a difference.\r\nAnd my membership site has been created with the same purpose. It is to bring together a group of like minded people who will collectively work to help other people make better decisions faster and more consistently.\r\nNow why am I doing all this? Giving away a crazy discount on my program, giving so many bonuses free? Its because I want to enable as many people as possible make better decisions faster and more consistently.\r\n\r\nSo a membership into an elite club costs lakhs; I think 30,000 is a really reasonable price to put on membership to such a club. I actually charge that much, for those who don’t attend my program.\r\n\r\nSo access to my membership site worth 30,000 is completely free.\r\n\r\nWhere are we now, full access to my program worth 90,000 (which is not 90,000 only for today.\r\nAudio program worth 20,000\r\nVideo program worth 20000\r\nMy book worth 800\r\nMembership site worth 30,000\r\n\r\nAnd, and and not to forget.

And I don’t think you can put a price on that- to actually contribute to improving somebody else’s life.\r\n \r\nSo you get all of these bonuses worth 71000 for free, along with an incalculable contribution to somebody else’s life. \r\n\r\nThe price of my program was 90,000.

All of you have been given one chit of paper with an alphabet written on it when you entered the hall. Anybody without a chit please raise your hands. Okay so everyone has a chit. Now let me explain how the game goes.\r\nThere are 10 chits of the same alphabet. Each alphabet represents a family. When the time starts each one of you have to get up from your seat and find your family. i.e. find the other members of your family. Eg A person with Chit “A” will find and gather the balance nine members of family A. Whichever family is formed first will be the winner. The winning family has to reach the stage and show their chits.\r\nYour time starts now!!\r\nAfter about 15 minutes: Ok now we have family H on stage and they have all 10 members together. So H is the winner\r\nNow all the balance families form groups together and choose one head of the family. You have 10 minutes.\r\nSo now I will pick up some random head. Head of family C pls introduce all the members of your family.\r\nHis answer will obviously be I don’t know them. Why? Because I just met them.\r\nSo what is the learning from this exercise?\r\nWe don’t choose our family.  How nice it would be if we could first analyse and then choose our parents , our brothers and sisters , in laws etc. What a wonderful world it would be with only people who we like around us. Right or Right?\r\nI remember when I was a kid … probably in primary school.\r\nWe would have our school assembly at 7.45 am. But every morning I had to be at the bus stop at 7 am.  Yes 7 am!!!!! So I had to leave home at 6.45 am…..Because according to my mom “ What if the bus comes early???? You cannot miss the school bus. And you know what ….she would wake me up at 6 am…… Who wakes up at 6 am…If you look out of the window its so dark …its like waking up at mid night man!!!!. I would get out of bed with my eyes closed and would be dragged to the bathroom and a hand would come out of nowhere and force my mouth open and brush my teeth. Then she would scream Open your mouth and she would make me rinse my mouth. Ooof what torture.  And then I had to take bath. Who takes bath so early in the morning dude!!!!!!!!!\r\nYou know what at times I would just turn on the shower  and take a short nap sitting on the pot. Nobody would know. And then a loud bang bang on the door would wake me up. I would simply take some water and wet my hair and face and come out. You see my mom was in the habit of touching my hair to see if I had wiped it properly. And it did not matter whether I wiped it or not because either ways she would say “When will you learn to wipe your hair dry?” Then I would be shoved into the uniform, my hair would get combed with my eyes still half closed and I would be dragged to the breakfast table where I had to undergo third degree torture…….the ordeal of breakfast. It was a rule in my house that no one could leave the house without having breakfast. Now it does not matter whether you leave at 9 am or whether you leave in the middle of the night at 6.45 am like me or whether my dad had to leave at 4 am to catch an early morning flight. My hyper active mom would be up in the morning and rush into the kitchen to make breakfast . And breakfast was what!!!! Aloo paratha or idli or dosa. Her funda was that one must eat heavy breakfast in the morning. And you know what she did not believe in keeping a help for cooking. Because according to her when the lady of the house cooked positive energy would flow into the food from her hands..how do you like that…and with the same positive energy filled hands she would shove that breakfast down my throat. Eating would take so long. Back then I would think …Ohh what a waste of time eating is. It would take me 30 minutes to eat that breakfast. I could have slept for 30 more minutes man…. \r\nAnyways then a big glass….glass not cup  those long steel glasses we had in those days…would come with steaming hot bournvita which would be flushed down my throat. \r\nAfter all these various degrees of torture I had to walk to the bus stop from where my school bus would pick me. I would then sleep in the bus for half an hour till the bus reached school.You know the distance from my house till my school was just 10 minutes but my school bus would do a complete Mumbai darshan before reaching school.\r\nI would always envy my friend Raji. I had this constant complaint with God. Why was I not born in Raji’s house. Why were Raji’s parents not my parents. You want to know why? Well  Raji would come to school by car everyday. She was allowed to take bath the previous day and hence bath in the morning was excused. She would have a cup of tea only…u heard that TEA ONLY in the morning. Her mother would not bother to cook …it was the maid who cooked and the maid would not come before  8 am. So no question of third degree torture. Her father was a rich man …they had two cars so the driver would drop her to school and pick her up everyday. Raji would wake up at 7.30 and leave home at 7.35 to reach school in time for the assembly. And poor me had to wake up at 6 am to reach school in time for the assembly. Oh God  what wrong did I do in my previous birth to deserve this set of military rule house.\r\nOf course later on I realised how hardworking my mother was and it was her love and concern for me which made her do what she did. And eventually when I grew up and had children of my own I ensured and continue to ensure that no one leaves the house without breakfast whether my family likes it or not.\r\nComing back to the point..Well we cannot choose our family right.  We are born into a family. We cannot choose our parents, our brothers sisters, our grandparents, our cousins, uncles aunts. With our own family tree we will at least find some similarities in nature some more similarities in lifestyle and even more similarities in food habits.\r\nBut the irony is when we have to live with someone from a different breed altogether..And the breed is  “ you know what”\r\nWe shall continue our discussion after a short break. In this break I have a small exercise for you. \r\nWe have about  15 families right. So each family get into a huddle and get to know each other. When I say each other means find out everything about the other person. Remember you are a family. So assuming you all are living in one house find out all u need to know. Lets take an example. I will ask a few questions to family A. \r\nDo u have breakfast in the morning or do u  prefer having only tea\r\nCan u sleep with the light on because I need the light on while sleeping\r\nI don’t like onion in my food how about u.\r\nWhat time do you leave for work..u see I leave at 8 so I need the bathroom at 7.30\r\nAs a family you people have to make a schedule keeping in mind everyone’s convenience. Imagine you are three couples and four children living in a 3 BHK with one kitchen and of course three bathrooms.\r\nSo take a sheet of paper and plan out your schedule\r\nWe will now take  30 minute break for tea. You can do this exercise as you have tea.\r\n11.00 am \r\n7)Tea break \r\n11.30 am\r\nEverybody ready with your findings. Ok who would like to share. \r\nSharings of 3 families\r\n12 noon.\r\nWhen we gathered here this morning most of us did not know each other. We have now formed families and done some changes in our own behaviour so that we are compatable to the balance members of our family right.\r\nSo now lets just list out what all we think are the tools that are  essential to ensure that these 10 members live in harmony and peace in one house.\r\n(Have a brain storming session and list out on chart paper what all is needed for a smooth relationship of a family)\r\nCoordination, Acceptance, Commumication, Adjustment,,bla bla blu blu. We have a whole list ready but we cannot cover all these points in detail here. In my three month programme which is more focussed on couple relationships I will take you through all these points in greater detail.(seeding)\r\nThis is about family. These qualities are even more essential when it comes to dealing with “in laws”\r\nBecause that of course is a different breed. Of course in today’s day and age we don’t see joint families any more. Once upon a time we had four generations living under one roof. The so called Hindu undivided family …the family that was not divided at all and size of the house did not matter. All were protected and comfortable under one roof.\r\nThen as life started progressing people started getting more and more educated, the educated clan started feeling suffocated in bigger houses. Hence the need for division. Then you had grandfather , grandmother, ONE son his wife and two grand children…that’s it. Six of them. The other sons had to find other places to live in and those were known to be nuclear families. The son who was staying with the parents was known to be staying in a joint family. House belonged to the father but the son claimed that his parents were staying with him as if he was doing a noble deed not to mention what the daughter in law felt .\r\nVery soon that also became a crowd as money started flowing in and people got more and more educated it became just parents and one child known as nuclear family. \r\nToday once the child is 16 he wants space. Mother has her own career Father has his own career and child has her own life. There is a generation gap between a 16 year old and the parents who probably be 40. The parents are on facebook and whatsapp and the child is on snapchat. My daughter tells me Ma what are u using facebook. Who uses facebook.\r\nHaving meals together at the dining table is no longer visible. In fact having dining tables is out of fashion these days is what my interior designer told me. Obiously because for one person to eat you don’t need a dining table right. You need at least six or four people at the table. Where will you get so many people from in one house when three people feel suffocated in a 3 BHK. In one house you cannot catch so many people together at the same time.Everyone wants space. Technology has become family. Everyone is educated and has been brought up with “space”. Hence the current generation cannot adjust to human beings. They get along very well with pets though. My daughter loves dogs. She does not mind 10 dogs in the house but I am sure if 10 human beings came and stayed in the same house after 24 hours she would feel the need for space.So these days when youngsters get married or get into a relationship the need for space comes up and the relationship goes down into the drain. Each one feels I AM XYZ. I have my own identity. Why should I bend. Why should I adjust. Earlier it was the girl who got married and came who was expected to adjust and sacrifice and be sober . But today a woman has become a man and a man is still a man. So like poles repel. \r\nDifferences always existed. But in earlier days the key was adjustment and the woman was expected to adjust. Today the woman wants acceptance and so does the man. Neither is the woman willing to change nor is the man. So adjustment is getting difficult in a couple relationship.\r\nMoreover amongst working couples invariably there is a confusion happening because the woman is earning and hence they are no longer submissive. But deep inside the feminity is still alive. They are still emotional. The feminism in a woman still needs to be nurtured. However independent and dominating she may be she still has a desire to be pampered by her man. She has a desire to talk and the only person available at home is her husband who does not want to talk as soon as he is back from work but wants “me time” wants his space with his first love  “TV” and second love ”internet”. After all this is when he feels recharged and he will go to his wife.The woman on the other hand feels the need to talk. She needs a listener. In earlier days in joint families women would speak to other women and fulfil this need. Even in case of home makers they would talk to friends neighbours and fulfil this need. But mostly in case of working women this emptiness remains. I have discussed this in detail in my programme but am unable to cover too much in detail here in this seminar of course.\r\n1.30 pm\r\n8) Lunch Break\r\nSo ladies and gentlemen lets take a break now . I will see you all back at 2.30\r\n2.30 pm\r\n9) Game\r\nEverybody has had a good lunch with family or without family. We will now have a game. Nominate two members from each team. All these nominated members will face me.The volunteer has handed over a chit mentioning the colour to each family i.e. the balance 8 members of the families. Nobody can talk you can use only body language for communicating. There are coloured toffees strewn across all over the room. Without speaking the balance 8 members have to communicate the colour to their two family members. These two family members will then go around and look for toffees of that colour. Once they have collected 10 of that colour they have to come on stage.\r\n10)Music and dance\r\nEach of the members of the winning team will show a step which all will follow. \r\n3.30 pm\r\n11) Let us list out all issues that couples face in a relationship. Lets break them into two categories.\r\nIssues faced by men….Ok so in all we have 10\r\nIssues faced by women….Ok so in all we have 20\r\nGreat so these issues will be discussed in detail and steps to tackle and solve these issues will be provided but not today.

Her husband was busy working and didn’t have the energy for his family when he came home –spent most of the time with their boys.

I will then start with Awareness data point.\n\nPeople must become aware of the actual problem because of which the situation has gone bad. The outcome of this step is to let people know that you have the solution with you. It’s only that once you understand the real causes of the problem and start changing yourself, the problems are going to be solved.\n\nThis will include a questionnaire asking what you think who (wife, husband or both) is responsible for the current state of their relationship. \nThen there will be a class share to let everyone know what people generally think.\n\nIt will include the story of a friend who used to think that all the problems are there with his wife.

I have worked in Corporate sector as an IT professional for more than 8.5 years with MNCs like Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services. \nYou all must be wondering that how come this IT professional is telling people about “how to make an amazing relationship”. Let me share with you the reason why I am standing here today.\nIt is because of the initial phase of my married life, I went through a very bad phase of marriage where there was so much mental pain.  \n Many incidents kept on rolling in the mind which is the primary cause of emotional pain. I used to think that will this suffering ever end? Few times we even discussed about divorce during verbal fight, however after some time when the mind gets calm, I used to think that this is not what I want. I love my wife and I don’t want divorce and why is it that every time we fight with each other and then go through huge emotional pain. The major problem was that we were not trying to understand the root cause of what all was happening.\nThere were one or two incidents where my wife said something which I didn’t like at all and we had huge fight. However after getting calm, when i thought about it, i realized that whatever she said was right. I could realize that i have a rigid mindset for few things and that needs to be changed in order to minimize these conflicts. That’s how i started getting aware about the fact that I need to change myself to change the situation.\nFrom that point i kept analyzing my behaviour and my wife’s behaviour and found out the root causes of the problems. Slowly i kept on working on them and the situation started improving. With time the conflicts were minimized and we both started loving each other’s company and the relationship became amazing.\nI kept on helping other known people also who were facing conflicts or feeling lack of love in the relationship by using the same principles that i had applied. I got some new insights from those cases as well. \nWith time the understanding became deeper and deeper and with all that analysis and understanding, i designed a system which i am going to share with you today. \nThis system comprises of 6 steps- \n1.	Awareness\n2.	Perception\n3.	Forgiveness\n4.	Understand your partner’s definition of love\n5.	Avoid blame game\n6.	Avoid assumptions , start communication\nAnyone who follows this system will know all the root causes of the problems in their relationship and the various ways by which these problems can be solved.\n', 0),

I heard his complete story and realized that he feels that his wife is responsible for most of the problems he is facing in his relationship. However after asking few questions, i could make him realize that he himself was equally responsible for the current situation of his relationship. \n\nWhen he got aware that he is also responsible for the problems in his marriage and he needs to change himself to make the situation better, his transformation journey began then and there.\n\n•	Perception - A client’s story will be shared about perception-how the client had made a perception about his wife. Because of a particular incident of his life, he had made a worst perception about the character of his wife. He used to drink and scold her and talk negative things about her. Even he used to say to his daughter about his wife that your mother is very bad. \n\nI got a chance to interact with his wife and during the discussion i could figure out that his wife was extremely loyal to her. Because of one incident of life, he created a negative perception about his wife’s character and kept on getting miserable because of it.\n\nI had done an activity with him to change his perception about his wife’s character and the results were amazing. The negative image got blurred at the very first time. Also he started practicing forgiveness because the incident kept on hunting him. The incident used to run in his mind almost everything making him disturbed. Within some time he could easily change his perception about his wife’s character and a major problem of his life got solved.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother story on perception- Another client of mine had an argument with her husband. My client said something very negative during the argument. My client was so angry at that moment that she couldn’t even realize that she passed an extremely negative comment. She forgot about the incident when situation became normal. However my client’s husband felt extremely bad and made a perception - this is what she thinks about me. The incident kept on rolling in his mind but he never discussed the same with his wife. The perception became stronger and their relationship started falling apart.  \n\nI got a chance to talk to her husband and I asked him- What went wrong? He told me about the complete incident and how he made a negative perception of his wife that she thinks badly about him. \n\nI narrated the whole conversation to my client and she was shocked. She didn’t even know that situation got worse just because of that one incident. I explained her importance of perception and how the perception can be changed.\n. \nShe went to the husband and apologizes for the same and mentioned that she will be extremely careful that she doesn’t repeat the same thing. \n\nI got one or two activities done with my client’s husband to change his perception about her wife.

Working in a IT company with big hopes to become Rick and working hard every single day burning lot of extra hours at office just for a couple of % as hikes came to know about stock market as a huge opportunity to earn.\r\nHe quickly opened a trading account with one of the broking firm and invested around 50000 as capital. But he has no knowledge about stock market and all he believed was that the analyst will help him do high profitable trades.\r\nHe used to check news occasionally. Once he saw the company Amtek Auto making highs every single day and it skyrocketed like anything. The share price has reached around 250 and he thought it is going to continue the trend and thought of investing the amount and get at least 10% and get out of the stock. \r\nHe invested the entire 50000 buying the stock at around 250. Unfortunately from the very next day the tock started falling from that level. He was thinking it was just a small correction and it would rebounded again. But to his bad luck, it kept falling, further and further. He now decided to hold it few more months and he was confident that it would reach the same level and go up in few months. But it kept falling further and further. The Stock price came to 25. He lost 90% of the investment. He now lost hopes on this stock and also on the stock market. \r\nHe was broke and depressed. The amount which was saved little and little every month got vanished in just few months.\r\nLearnings:\r\nI had a discussion with him once and asked him what is the actual problem?\r\n•	He said there was a sudden bad news over night\r\n•	The stock revenue and profit were not good\r\n•	The whole market was in to downtrend\r\n•	Global scenario was bad\r\nI told him that these are not the actual reason for your loss. It is YOU who is responsible for your loss and I want you to understand that.\r\n1. Do you have any basic knowledge of Stock Market and how it operates?\r\n2. Do you practice you investing and trading with a structured process?\r\n3. Did you learn the discipline and patience that is mandatory while dealing in Stock Market?\r\n4. Do you know the basic rules to do predictions in Stock picks?\r\n\r\nAnd his answer was NO for all of the above. \r\nThen it is very difficult to make money in Stock Market.\r\nOnly when a person i able to say YES to all of the above questions he can start investing and trading in Stock Market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestionnaire\r\nI will share a set of questionnaires to the participants to increase the pain points\r\nDo you have a proper money management? What are the things that are lacking in you to manage your money?\r\nWhat is stopping you from becoming a millionaire?\r\nWhat are the big hurdles that you face when it comes to investing?\r\n  \r\nStory 2: My Story – How I became successful in making consistent profits \r\nHello Everyone, let me tell you a little about myself and how my journey started.\r\nI\'m an average student in school and in my college and like you all, I had a lot of financial issues for my education and I completed it by taking bank loans. During this tough period of time, I understood the importance of money and I believed that money can give you a comfortable life. I got a job in an IT firm after engineering and got around 18K pm. But I always dreamt of achieving financial freedom but achieving it is not that easy. It cannot be achieved with my current job alone.\r\nI tracked a lot of business people and billionaires to understand how they achieved financial freedom. After intense research there was 2 things in common.\r\n\r\nSecondary Income and Passive Income\r\n\r\nI made a decision on that day that I should start finding ways of making secondary income and passive income. Buy How?\r\nI\'m not expert in any field to start making that money. So I started exploring on all the possible ways of making money.\r\n\r\n1. Created a website.\r\n2. Affiliate Marketing\r\n3. Teaching on some random subjects\r\n4. Various online money making methods etc\r\nBut nothing worked well for me.\r\n\r\nOne day I came to know from Economic Times about Stock Market and I can see many people earning huge in fact earning millions. I was shocked to read about these people. I read about alot more people until I completely believed that I too can make money in Stock Market and its not something fake.\r\nI started learning about Stock Market from that day and tried to put my learning in to practice. But I kept failing. But I never gave up, I understood that I need to learn more and practice more to succeed in Stock Market. I continued to learn with the hope that one day I will be successful.\r\nI understood that I cannot be successful if I don\'t have a system so I create a 4 stage system with all the learning I had so far and followed it no matter what.\r\nAnd I was able to make consistent profits in Stock Market and achieve success.\r\nIt has been 8 years and I\'m happy to be successful in Stock Market. I faced a lot of pain and challenges during these 8 years and I doesn\'t want everyone else to face those challenges.\r\nSo I started training people who are really serious about their life and have big dreams to achieve. I have created a 4 stage system which worked for me and many of my students to make consistent profits in stock market.\r\nOne of my students followed my system and made 32% in just 3 months which is amazing. I want to spread my knowledge and my 4 stage system to as many as possible and help people achieve their financial freedom.\r\nIn order for a person to achieve success in Stock Market, a system is very important to earn profits consistently which I will be able to provide you.\r\n\r\nOutcome:\r\n1.	A proper money management system\r\n2.	learn the system to trade for short term and medium term in Stock Market\r\nStory 3:\r\nI have a friend Arun and like every one else he too wants to become rich. He is 25 years old and he thought the only way to become rich is by increasing his salary. So he worked hard but he didn’t know that in order to become rich and achieve financial freedom earning is not enough.\r\nEvery year his salary got increased but he never was able to save any money. With increase in salary, his expenses too got increased so there was no proper savings.\r\nMost of us here are in the same situation. We feel that we need to increase our salary to become rich but you can never achieve financial freedom with that. One of the main reasons being when our salary increases we increase our expenses and not the savings. \r\nOne must have a proper money management system to achieve Financial Freedom. \r\nThe second most important is to have a proper investment techniques from which you make money from money.\r\nIn the case of Arun, I understood that he doesn’t have a money management system and has no investment techniques as well. So I offered my 3 month program “The Millionaire Trading Formula” through which \r\nHe learnt a proper money management system \r\nHe learnt my entire system on investment and trading in stock market from which he now earns consistent profits every month.\r\nHe is now able to manage his hard earned money and even invest and trade that money in Stock Market and make more money.\r\n', 0),

But he has no knowledge about stock market and all he believed was that the analyst will help him do high profitable trades.\r\nHe used to check news occasionally. Once he saw the company Amtek Auto making highs every single day and it skyrocketed like anything. The share price has reached around 250 and he thought it is going to continue the trend and thought of investing the amount and get at least 10% and get out of the stock. \r\nHe invested the entire 50000 buying the stock at around 250. Unfortunately from the very next day the tock started falling from that level. He was thinking it was just a small correction and it would rebounded again. But to his bad luck, it kept falling, further and further. He now decided to hold it few more months and he was confident that it would reach the same level and go up in few months.

(942, 580950, 3, 2, 'My life was initially full of struggle. As a child I suffered from bronchitis and innumerable viral fever attacks, was plagued with injuries and I struggled between hospital, home and school. As I grew old, I got better but suffered from Jaundice followed by Malaria, in my late teens. \r\nI got over it and then in my 20’s I got a reattack of Jaundice and was so severe that I used to lie down cringing my stomach. This time I could get over with difficulty, \r\n\r\nIn my mid 30’s I got typhoid fever and third attack of jaundice. I resolved to get over all my diseases. However, as I was recovering I found myself getting breathless whenever I was using stair cases. My blood test confirmed low haemoglobin count. I was diagnosed of minor thalassemia, which roughly means that red blood cells are little shrined so the capacity to take oxygen or haemoglobin is lesser. I was returned from blood donation camp twice due to low haemoglobin.  I got depressed and obese at the same time. Now I had my bad cholesterol on higher side and then I suffered from Gout attack also called as arthritis of small joints, It was so painful that I could not touch my feet on ground. I used to toss in bed all night for 15 days. Increased uric acid was to be blamed. \r\nAround late 30’s I realised that things are not going well for me. I need to make a system to improve my health and make U turn else the future was looking bleak.  Another random blood test confirmed that I had hyper thyroid. So I sincerely set up a process and followed religiously for next 6 months. I found drastic improvements. I did not had gout attacks which were reoccurring every 3 months, my good cholesterol improved, I could get my TSH levels within acceptable levels. My stamina increased. I got back in shape. I re-acquired my youthful looks. In short my system worked fine. I had support of my wife, who is MBBS doctor, my friend who is homeopathy doctor. I also had consulted few relatives and friends who had already suffered this uric acid issue. They could advice the alteration in my diet. I also consulted some gym experts and online research on internet. I went more into cardio and lesser on weight training, I also started yoga pranayama and asanas. I also developed some spiritual visits which helped me big time as faith can move the mountains, \r\nIt was not an overnight change but I got the result within three months. This made me realise that we need some systematic process which can definitely give results we desire.\r\nThen I shared the same system with my wife, who was also suffering from thyroid and was getting obese by every month. She could regain her health and fitness in few months, this process was repeated over and over again and was successful every time. Why? \r\nBecause it was easy to follow, had all the emotional support, experience of people who already were suffering from similar problems and was inspirational. \r\nGod has been so generous to me that I don’t have words to thank him. He had showered me with the great love, the blessings, the happiness, the wealth, the assets, the youth, the health, true friends and the love of my family. The list is endless and I thank him for giving me a motto to talk with you guys and express myself.\r\n\r\nNow that I got everything very well, I am full of passion and desire to go to the world and share my love and passion, good health motivation and happiness with the world. I would like to suggest them the way of living, so that you must understand the priority in life. I mean what is the use of millions in bank account if you don\'t have good health and relations in old age.\r\n           I know lot of people who are senior directors, managers and CEO in an organization who are very successful professionally, but their health is not good. Their family is suffering as they are slogging in offices for that extra success and compromising on health of themselves and family. I know about their wives who are into depression, unhappiness, and so many diseases after suffering from negligence and lack of care.  \r\n          I also know of their children who also got into cycle of unhappiness, depression, extreme sadness, drugs and alcohol, unusual behaviour and bad health. They have also got suicidal tendencies as they don\'t have enough guidance from their parents. How would the director/ manager feel when he goes home after a tiring day?\r\nWould he feel happy, energetic or motivated to maintain the relationship? It\'s highly unlikely ... It\'s easy to guess so the directors and the rich businessman neglect the situation till it gets worst.  \r\n            The motive of my life is to telling the right way of living, maintaining a good health, relationship and a purposeful life.\r\n \r\nIt would be a long story  but somewhere we have to start , so first thing , I would like to focus on taking care of own health, and then I will move into how to handle success relationships & love . \r\nI can assure you that everyone can be benefitted and improve themselves.\r\nI love to teach people. I have crossed tough times both in case of health and relationship. I have advised many friends on health and health tips. I have the zeal and presentation skills.  I have the positive attitude and go-getter perspective.  So I am a winner and I want to teach others to be winner.\r\n\r\nPeople compromise either on money or health.

(973, 225501, 3, 2, 'I was working in a Bombay after my post-graduation in IIT. In 1994 I was selected by one IT organization to send me to US for long assignment. I was about to leave for US within next  one month. Unfortunately I had an accidental fall from 4th floor balcony. I was severely injured and was hospitalized for 2 Years. I was left paralyzed below my waist and became wheelchair bound permanently. I had multiple fractures to my right hand. It took 2 years recover myself and come out of hospital. It took lot of challenges to overcome my injury. My life completely depended on the wheelchair. I didn’t have any job. Later joined an IT Organization after 2 years of stay in the hospital. It was quite uphill task to face the hardships during my stay in the hospital. I was almost operated 16 times during my stay. I even plan to end my life but I couldn’t end my life as I couldn’t walk. After 2 years of my stay in the hospital,  I got the job in Bangalore. I gradually built my name in the organization and with my good performance I was made Manager for quality and made in-charge for a team to lead. They sponsored even hand controlled car to drive due to my high performance. I was also sent to headquarters in Netherland for  making presentation the work at that was done in India to get a Quality certification. Life was going great professionally.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in the hospital it so happened, a nurse aged 20 years became good friend of me. Later on, this friendship turned out to love, we started loving each other. She said she will take care of me forever, want to help me and bring me to the main stream. This was something which I had not even dreamt as such a thing would happen in my life, I readily accepted her friendship and later we got married to each other within one year after coming to Bengaluru.\r\n\r\nAfter 2 Years of marriage, we adopted a boy of 9 months. My family was going great guns and I was leading happy contented life both professionally and personally. My son became 2.5 years old. All of sudden due to best reasons known to her, my wife wanted to get separated from us. It was very difficult to sustain this shock, we got separated. The entire responsibility of taking care of me and my son was left to me. There were no one to take care of us, I had to manage my life with help of caregivers. I have been managing my life with my son with the help of caregivers since then till today. Now my son is 19 years old. Life has never been easy but still I am leading powerful and enjoying my life with my son. I have always gone beyond the challenges life has thrown up on me.\r\n\r\nIn 2009 I left my job and started on my own as a Freelance consultant  and trainer. I always wanted to create self-employment so that I don’t depend on the job. Today I am practicing as a Consultant, Trainer and coach since 9 years working from home. I don’t have any debts and own my 3 bed-room flat and  all essential luxuries  for  middle class family and living life of my own. I have travelled 6 countries on the wheelchair. I keep travelling within India all alone to provide training, Leading a life of complete Independence and going beyond all my  limitations. I am managing my life on my own and leading respectable life. I want to use my life as an experience to make difference in people lives. Life is full of challenges and it is matter of choice to go head or remain in a corner. Whenever life throws up challenges, only when we go beyond those challenges we can live extra ordinary life. Then only we can lead life of our own. I want to use these experience in my seminars and talks. The main message in my seminars “How to be unstoppable, lead limitless life”. There is no limit in life, life is full of abundance and prosperity. If one has patience, perseverance and learn from the failures than thinking them as problems, one can achieve almost anything in the life. \r\n\r\nWrite your ETR.\r\n1. 	Off the late apart from professional work, I have started giving motivational talks.\r\n2. 	A radio program about my life was aired in my home state. It was highly appreciated by many who listened my program. The people who appreciated and inspired included physically challenged, some visually blind, housewives, some students and young people. Lot of people were motivated and inspired after hearing the way I have faced challenges in spite of being physically challenged and still leading successful and happy life.\r\n3. 	I was invited to give motivational talk to final year engineering students to motivate them, using my life examples. The talk was highly appreciated by them, some of them even asked me write a book “How to be Unstoppable”\r\n4. 	I want to make difference in other lives wherever possible. People have changed or their lives transformed, when they talk to me or after they come to know about my life experiences. People who talk to me are the one who have got stuck in their lives and have several issues like job, career, financial, family, sudden death of their loved ones and separation from their loved ones etc.\r\n', 0),

(981, 454474, 2, 2, 'Preview script:\r\n\r\n2 hours\r\n\r\nMinute 1 to 15:\r\n\r\nHi my name is Avinash! I take good decisions quickly and consistently. \r\nI remember a time when I was coming back from a 600 km roadtrip with my family. My kid, who was a baby then had a bad tummy, we were tired. We were also very hungry. We were trying to decide where to have our dinner. And like all family discussions, we got nowhere. It went on and on and on for almost 10 minutes! I was quiet the whole time. Finally I couldn\'t take it anymore, and said, \"We\'re going to Agarwal Bhavan. Its close by, clean and tasty.\" The moment I said that there was pin drop silence in the car. My decision ticked off all the boxes that we were talking about. \r\n\r\nAsk the audience- How many of you take decisions? How many don\'t take decisions? How many take decisions quickly? How many take forever to take a decision?\r\n\r\nMy career story:\r\n\r\nAsk the audience- How many of you have done engineering? How many non- engineering? How many of you decided that you wanted to pursue a particular education path and then actively went after it? For how many of you was the decision taken by someone other than yourself?\r\n\r\nSo I did my engineering, specialised in mechanical Engineering. And the reasoning for mechanical was that I could move into any field of study I wished. At that time, Infosys and Wipro were still hiring mechanical engineers. So we thought I could get hired by both engineering and non- engineering companies. Which, at that time, seemed to be a sound, logical reasoning. So it was decided that mechanical it would be!\r\n\r\nI was horrible at it. I hated every single class and lab. I just couldn’t understand what we were supposed to study, and how to study. In fact, my dad used to teach me after college. \r\n\r\nI stumbled and fumbled my way through the four years of Engineering, finally looking at the end point- and what is the end point of engineering? \r\n\r\nPLACEMENTS!!\r\n\r\nI didn’t make it through Infosys, or Wipro or HP or IBM or any of the 20 other companies that came to my college. \r\n\r\nTowards the end of the placement season, I got placed in Godrej. Actually I had another offer too- to work in a call centre, because that was the time they were booming. And I had to make a decision- earn more in a call centre, or do what my heart told me to. So I decided- I took up the sales job at Godrej.  And my profile was sales. I had just got my first job! I started with a salary of 10,000 per month, and I used to blow it all up. I had a very strange way of spending my money- I used to save it all up till the 20th, and spend everything before the 30th.\r\n\r\nI worked in Godrej for about 10 months. I was really bored with the job. I hated the fact that I struggled through 4 years of Engineering, and I mean really struggled through it, only to sell office furniture- tables, chairs and conference tables.\r\n\r\nSo I made a decision to change my industry completely. I wanted to work in a core engineering company. One of my colleagues had just done a high profile MBA from some college, and was pretty well connected. So I asked him if he knew someone in a core engineering company. He connected me to his friend in SKF. I contacted that friend and asked him if there were any opportunities. The only available opportunity was to attend a placement round at another college. \r\n\r\nHere was another dilemma- should I forgo the 10 months experience at Godrej and join as a fresher in SKF? Or continue to show up at a job I hated? Because I would have to join SKF as a fresher again and begin my career from scratch.\r\n\r\nSo I took a decision to attend the campus interview a second time and restart. \r\n\r\nYou see, I hated my job at Godrej that much. Which leads me to a question- how do you take decisions? \r\n\r\nFor example, lets take Bangalore traffic- how many would like to move out of Bangalore because of the traffic and infrastructure issues? How many would like to move out because moving out opens up a whole new range of possibilities?\r\n\r\nThere is actually a formula to this- which Ill cover in more detail a little later.\r\n\r\nNow I had a pretty good run at SKF, I worked there for almost 5 years. I was in Pune, just completed my year long training period. In my training period I was in the ADC at Bangalore, working on developing new products. In fact, I played a role in the development of the Royal Enfield speedometer. Till then, all the speedometers on bikes were driven by a cable. The new system that we developed used sensors- it was a far more accurate system, more efficient and would never break down. I can tell u more about it if time permits. After 6 months at ADC I moved to Pune where I was in charge of supervising the shop floor production of Hub bearings. These are the ones that you find inside the wheels of every single Maruti and Tata cars that are plying.\r\n\r\nAfter my training period, I was again faced with a decision to make- I had a choice of either continuing to work in Pune on the shop floor, or move to Coimbatore in a Sales role. \r\n\r\nI desperately wanted to come back to Bangalore, but I couldn’t. So I chose Coimbatore. BTW, the same formula which I spoke about earlier applies to this situation as well. \r\n\r\nI worked in Coimbatore for 2 years, and found an opportunity to come back to Bangalore. I came back, and decided that my resume needed to become more fancy. I decided that I needed to do an MBA. \r\n\r\nNow why did I take this decision? Because everyone else was doing an MBA. As my mentor says, every man and his dog have an MBA now. \r\n\r\nI started giving interviews as soon as I landed back to Bangalore- I went to Volvo, Exide, 3M, Timken and a few others I don’t recall. The person who took my interview at 3M soon resigned from his position and joined Honeywell. He remembered me from the interview. Especially because I had done well and had got an offer as well, which I didn’t take. He called me to join his team at Honeywell. Again, I had a decision to make, but this time it was a much easier decision- the salary being offered was 3 times what I was earning at SKF. So I jumped at the opportunity. \r\n\r\nTheres a formula to decision making here too, and yes, its the same as before.\r\n\r\nIn Honeywell I worked in sales for 2 years, then moved to something called Marketing Communications, a role in which I stayed for another 3 years. In my role I was responsible for conducting and managing events in which we would have our stall. The outcome was to increase our visibility to our target market and generate leads, which the sales team would later follow up on.\r\n\r\nI remember the first event that I managed. What a nightmare! I had to coordinate between the event organisers, the guys who would build our stall, get quotations, arrange for payments, oversee the stall construction. And coordinate with the internal guys to make sure the product samples moved on time. And this was in Mumbai, so the octroi issue. It was a crazy time!\r\n\r\nHowever, by the third event, I had developed my own system. It was a systematic 5 step process that I developed. I had check lists, time lines and email templates. By the fourth one, I did not have to work at it at all. All I had to do was run my system, and things would fall in place.\r\n\r\nBy now I had been working almost 12 years. And I had begun to feel that my career was going nowhere. I used to ask myself questions like, “Can I sustain this in the long run?”, “Is this what I really wanted to do?” \r\n\r\nBecause you see, our society has laid out a pretty good system for us. Finish 16 years of education, get a job, get another job, buy a car. By doing this, you become eligible in the marriage market. And what I had done in my career served this purpose. I fell in love with my wife, and there weren’t too many objections to get married. But now that that purpose had been served, what next?\r\n\r\nSo I decided to do something radically different. You see, I had been an active toastmaster for almost 10 years. So I wanted to teach, to train, to get in front of an audience and bring about transformation. \r\n\r\nI got the very same opportunity. I took up responsibility as a placement officer in an engineering college. In this position I arranged number of opportunities for the kids to start their career, I used to go out of my way to teach them the basics of effective communication and how to give interviews. I organised Yoga and meditation sessions in the college for them. It was my way of doing what I wanted to do, and to give back to society as well. I was living a dream.\r\n\r\nThen one day, the management of the college calls me to their cabin and says, “We have decided to relieve of your duties. Today is your last day in the college. Please submit your resignation letter.”\r\n\r\nIt was as if my entire identity had been taken away in 2 seconds. Whatever I had worked for, everything that I stood for, was just removed in an instant. I had gone from being somebody who mattered to a nobody. Now it didn’t matter if I slept all day, didn’t shower or got drunk in the morning. No one cared…\r\n\r\nI remember the scene vividly. I stepped out of the cabin confidently, but on the inside I was in shock. I walked a few steps, and some students were milling around. They saw me and wished me good morning. It was as if the sound was coming from somewhere far off, like it was muffled. I walked a few more steps and slumped into a chair meant for the visitors. I sat in silence for a few minutes. Too I bought myself together and went up to my office. From there I called my wife and dad and told them what had just happened. They tried to give me some advice, but I wasn’t listening. I typed out my resignation letter and went back to the principals chamber. I handed it over in silence, he took it in silence. I went back up to my cabin and began to pack my stuff. It all fit into a box, which I carried to my car. I got in, and drove off home.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I saw when I got home was my one year old son. The moment I saw him I felt a little better. I played with him for some time. \r\n\r\nThat evening, as I sat alone, I realised that this was the biggest decision I would have to make in my life- I had 2 choices- to sit around all day, mope and brood over what had happened, or to pick myself up again, start afresh and rebuild my career. \r\n\r\nSo I took the decision to rebuild it.\r\n\r\nSoon I started mentoring students about what career choices they had, how they should plan their career, a sort of career counselling. \r\n\r\nA few months later, I started a toy rental company- where I would give toys on rent on a fortnightly basis. \r\n\r\nA few more months later, I started freelancing as a content writer, too after I started conducting IELTS training classes. \r\n\r\nThat day, I took a decision to never ever give up on anything. And that has been the best decision I ever took. To keep that warrior spirit going, no matter what.\r\n\r\nMinute 15 to 20:\r\n\r\nNow do a state change- ask the audience to share the biggest decision they have taken, and what was the consequence of that?\r\n\r\n“Who would like to share?” Raise hand\r\n\r\nThank you! Give them a hand!\r\n\r\nWho else would like to share? Raise hand\r\n\r\nThank you! Give them a hand!\r\n\r\nWho else would like to share?\r\n\r\nHow many of you relate to that?\r\n\r\nYou know, I think its really really important to have a coach. I call it coach, some call it mentor, some call it friend. Its really important to have a person in your life who you can depend upon for support and guidance. \r\n\r\nHow many of us have such a person? How many don’t? \r\n\r\nThis person in my life is my dad. He is the best coach I could ever have. Because he has always encouraged me to do what I wanted to do. And he has stood by my side throughout. He never gives advice, but he is always there like a strong pillar. His mantra is, “You decide.” \r\n\r\nI think that by doing that, he puts the entire accountability on me. I learnt because of this, that I am fully responsible for my life. I am responsible for things that I do, and responsible for the consequences of things that didn’t do. \r\n\r\nEvery single job that I found, I found on my own. Godrej, SKF, Honeywell, College, all the interview opportunities- everything I did on my own. Even all the business ventures, he would ask me if I have evaluated them in detail, and after secretly evaluating whether it was a good move or not, he would ask me, “So what do you want to do?” \r\n\r\nIt’s so great to have a coach like him! How much I have learnt from my dad, I cant even begin to describe it. \r\n\r\nMinute 22 to 42:\r\n\r\nPlay a game:\r\n\r\nDivide the group into groups of 5\r\n\r\nObjective: to create a compelling/ inspirational story.\r\nOutcome: state change\r\n\r\nMethod: \r\n\r\nEvery member of the group shares his/ her own personal impactful decisions that they have taken in their life.\r\n\r\nAs a group, everyone decides which decisions to include.\r\n\r\nBased on the decisions they include, they create a compelling/ inspirational story about a fictional character.\r\n\r\nThe team leaders share their team’s story.\r\nTotal time 20 minutes.\r\nMinute 42 to 60: Victim mode\r\n\r\nMy story- \r\n\r\nAt the time I was fired, all I could think about was, “Why must this happen only to me?”\r\n\r\nOn the one hand I had everything going for me, I had a happy family, I had had a good corporate experience, I was earning well. Now when I wanted to do something that I wanted to do, this happened. \r\n\r\nKash’s story-\r\n\r\nI have a really good friend. She’s from Mumbai, from a pretty rich family. Her family is in touch with the who’s who of Mumbai, and of Bollywood. In fact, as a child Amitabh Bachchan played with her, and she’s distantly related to Govinda. \r\n\r\nShe’s an amazing person. Very lively, bubbly and full of energy. Just such a loveable person. Truly a gem. She’s also a gold medallist in her MBA. \r\n\r\nAnd I know her because she joined SKF the same year I did. She joined as a Management Trainee because she had done her MBA, and I joined as a GraduateEngineer Trainee because I had done only engineering. \r\n\r\nSoon after completing my 1 year training in SKF, or was it during, I don’t remember exactly, she lost her brother. He was just 34. He left behind a wife and 2 small kids. He passed away of a heart attack while at the gym. The same year, she lost her Grandmother. In one year, Kash lost the 2 people she was closest to.\r\n\r\nHere was a gem of a woman, highly educated, fully capable of succeeding in the world, of marriageable age, and facing a massive setback. She didn’t get married. Instead she went into a shell. The first two years thereafter she found solace in food. She was overweight to begin with, now she really ballooned. She was depressed all the time. \r\n\r\nI was speaking to her the other day, and she told me that during that time, all that she could think of was, “Why me?” And “Is my life worth living?”\r\n\r\n<Long pause>\r\n\r\nTime for story- 8 minutes (minute 50)\r\n\r\nOk, moving on. Now lets play a little game.\r\n\r\nDraw a picture- any picture that comes to your mind.\r\n\r\nIll bet it relates to whats currently on your mind.\r\n\r\n“Who would like to share?” Raise hand\r\n\r\nThank you! Give them a hand!\r\n\r\nWho else would like to share? Raise hand\r\n\r\nThank you! Give them a hand!\r\n\r\nWho else would like to share?\r\n\r\nHow many of you relate to that?\r\n\r\n\r\nTime for game- 10 Minutes (Minute 60)\r\nOk, now- whats the biggest area that people make wrong decisions in? \r\n\r\nWait for answers.\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE!!\r\n\r\nFriends, I have 3 truly horrific marriage stories.\r\n\r\nChethan\r\n\r\nChethan is another very close and dear friend. I know him from day 1 of college. So I walk into the classroom on day 1, the first lecture. I spot an empty seat and take it. Turns out the other guy sitting next to me is Chethan. And we’ve been friends since then. We’ve gone drinking together, we were the two who made pool, snooker and billiards popular among our batch. Of course he was way better than me at it.\r\n\r\nWe kind of fell out of touch after graduating. Mainly because I moved out to Pune and then to Coimbatore. When I came back to Bangalore, I got in touch with him again. Turns out he was in a pretty serious relationship. I cannot take the girl’s name because I do not have her permission. Let’s call her Mary Jane, just for convenience sake. \r\n\r\nA few months later, and they both decide to get married. Of course the parents wouldn’t agree, because Chethan is a Konkani Brahmin and Mary Jane is a Punjabi. So these 2 decide to get a court marriage, without telling their parents. And I was among the three who signed as a witness in the court.\r\n\r\nYou know, when you see a couple, you kind of know in your gut whether these two are made for each other or not. And when I looked at Chethan and Mary Jane, not only did I not get the feeling, I felt that they are a huge mismatch for each other. But what can rationality do in the face of intense emotions? They got married and began to live together. \r\n\r\nAnd man did they fight! They were at each other’s throats all the time!\r\n\r\nA few months later, and they told their parents that they were married, and parents being parents wanted to solemnise the relationship through the traditional means. So they both got married again. This time it was official. They called everyone to Mangalore and had a traditional Konkani wedding. Then they went to Indore and had a traditional Punjabi wedding. It was crazy.\r\n\r\nBut the fights didn’t stop even after the second time.\r\n\r\nYou see, Chethan wanted to have kids. He’s a nice guy that way. But Mary Jane had an absolute hatred towards kids. She had decided that she would be without kids throughout her life. And this was the reason for the friction.\r\n\r\nHer reasoning was that it would put a full stop to her career, and she was extremely career minded. All she wanted was to work overseas. In fact, she realised that she had to do her MBA first, and it was me who went to the college to help in the admission process.\r\n\r\nEventually she got a job in Hong Kong, and while she was about to move, their relationship was at an all time low. She left him and went to work. A few months later she told him that she will be divorcing him. She came to India, signed the divorce papers, and went back.\r\n\r\nImagine what my friend must have gone through! After everything he had done, and sacrificed for her. \r\n\r\n<Long pause>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSandeep\r\n\r\nSandeep was initially my colleague at work, and from there we became really good friends. His story is also very similar to Chethan’s. \r\n\r\nOnly, in this case, it was a little more vague. \r\n\r\nSandeep’s relationship with his wife was slowly deteriorating. His wife felt that it was not a good match, and started ignoring him. In fact, they would sleep next to each other, but face away from each other. \r\n\r\nWhat a horrible way to live in the same house! You’re in front of each other, but you don’t speak!\r\n\r\nOne fine day, his wife announces that she is going to divorce him. And he isn’t expecting it at all. All the while he has been preparing ways and means to fix the relationship, while his wife has been planning the divorce.\r\n\r\nAgain, the formula is at play here- the formula I spoke about in the beginning. And ill explain that shortly.\r\n\r\nSo she hands him the divorce papers, packs her stuff, and walks out.\r\n\r\nSantosh\r\n\r\nSantosh is probably the closest friend I have. We’ve been together since school. I have been witness to Santosh’s marriage from the day he got the proposal, till the day he got the divorce order from the court.\r\n\r\nHere too, the girl was wrong. It was just dumb that Santosh agreed to the marriage without thinking it through completely. But you know, as they say, when we take a decision, we do it with all the resources available to us at that time.\r\n\r\nSantosh and the girl get married, and within a few months, she starts demanding weird stuff. She wanted to live separately from his parents. He agreed, and shifted into a different house. Soon she refused to visit his parents altogether! And not just his parents, even his cousins, his colleagues, everybody he was connected to. The last straw was just after their child’s first birthday. She demanded that he cut off all his relations, and maintain only the relations with her side.\r\n\r\nNow normally Santosh is a nice guy. And by nice guy, I mean someone who finds it difficult to say no. \r\n\r\nBut this time, he had been pushed too far. He put his foot down and said “No. I am not cutting off any relations, neither with your family, nor with any of mine.” \r\n\r\nThen his wife packed up all her stuff, the kids stuff, making sure to return whatever gold and clothes and toys Santosh’s family had got and stormed out of the house with the child.\r\n\r\nPrashant\r\n\r\nThis one is probably the worst. This guy and his wife have not been getting along since the first week of getting married. They stay in Germany, and the guy is in India to visit his parents.\r\n\r\nHis wife is also in India, but he doesn’t know that. His wife files a criminal complaint against him, and lodges a FIR.\r\n\r\nNow his dilemma- He cant leave India with a criminal case against him. And he cant stay because his Indian visa expires soon. \r\n\r\nYou know, I think the decision to get married is probably the most critical one anyone can make in their life. \r\nIn the guys case, if he has the support of his wife, he can achieve anything. Otherwise, she can destroy the family.\r\n\r\nEven in the case of the girls too, if they decide to support their husband, they husband will do anything for them. But if they try to demand, and to tie them down then the husband will go elsewhere.\r\n\r\nTime for stories- 10 minutes (Minute 70)\r\n\r\nOk let’s play a small game\r\n\r\n<Pick a volunteer>\r\n\r\nOk, lets see, who is wearing a Blue top/ shirt?\r\n\r\nPick one, get him/ her on stage.\r\n\r\n“Is it ok if I ask you about your relationship? I don’t need all the details.”\r\n\r\nAre you married or unmarried?\r\n\r\nSingle or in a relationship?\r\n\r\nThe questions are just to get the ball rolling.\r\n\r\nThe important question-\r\n\r\nIf you were given complete freedom to create the partner of your dreams, what qualities would you add in your creation?\r\n\r\nThis step serves four purposes:\r\n\r\nBuild rapport and keep the audience engaged.\r\nSeed the idea that we have programs/ processes/ systems for everything we do.\r\nSeed the four steps of my system.\r\nGive the participant a breakthrough.\r\n\r\nWork off the participant’s answers for the next 3 minutes.\r\n\r\nOk so lets move on to a different kind of decision making- decision making in business.\r\n\r\nPranav is another very dear friend of mine. He too joined SKF as a Management Trainee. He belongs to a business family, and was working only to get some work related experience. His eventual plan was to join his family business. They are the largest exporter of dry ginger, and mainly export to Africa.\r\n\r\nNow Pranav joined the company as a salaried employee, because his ad was already a partner. Soon, his uncles took over the business and made sure Pranav was out of the whole equation. They didn’t want to give him a salary, in addition to the split between the partners. \r\n\r\nSo what does Pranav do?\r\n\r\nHe decides to start another business of his own. And he soon overtakes the other one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTime- 10 minutes (Minute 70)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinute 71 to 90: Empowering mode\r\n\r\nOne day I was chilling out at home. I was alone, and I was lost in my thoughts. My thoughts slowly drifted towards all the stories I just shared. As I was remembering the stories one by one, the realisation dawned in me. \r\n\r\nI realised that there was a common thread connecting all the stories. \r\n\r\nAnd that common thread was DECISIONS.\r\n\r\nIn my case, when I lost my job, I made a decision to pick myself up and rebuild my career.\r\n\r\nSame thing with Pranav.\r\n\r\nWith Kash too- she turned out to be the strongest among us! She decided that she cannot continue living like this. So she started working out, and started eating healthy. She dropped 20 kg in 2 years, and lost 10 years of age in the process.\r\n\r\nComing to the marriage horror stories-\r\n\r\nChethan decided within a few short weeks to move on. He decided that whats done is done. He attempted to make his marriage succeed, it didn’t work, time to move on. Today he is happily married.\r\n\r\nSandeep and Santosh too, decided to move on. He is actively looking for a suitable girl.\r\n\r\nThe last one, the Germany case- This was a very complicated case, because both husband and wife had German citizenship, their kid was also a German. He could neither leave, not stay back.\r\n\r\nHe decided that his immediate priority was to be able to move out of the country. So he had a discussion with his wife and she withdrew the complaint. They all went back to Germany within a week, and worked out their differences.\r\n\r\nThey both had decided that quitting and moving out of the marriage was not the solution. Instead they decided to stay together and accept each others differences. Its been 3 years now, and the entire family lies happily in Pune.\r\n\r\nMinute 71 to 75\r\n<>\r\n\r\nNow I dug deeper into these incidents, and tried to decode the exact process that all of us followed to get un- stuck and keep moving ahead. \r\n\r\nIt took me about 6 months, and in the process I wrote a book called Do. Decide. Repeat. I also created a whole bunch of videos and audios, and conducted interviews to see of everyone followed the same programming.\r\n\r\nWhat I learnt was a revelation. I realised that we are driven by decisions- from the smallest routine activity we do till the one off big things- it all boils down to decisions.\r\n\r\n<Now get into how we take the small decisions- Ex: we wear our clothes twice everyday, our decision to keep ourselves and hygienic and such small things.\r\nThen get into the bigger decisions like buying a house, a car, to change a job.\r\nAnother opportunity to create breakthroughs and seed my program>\r\n\r\nMinute 75 to 90\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinute 91 to 110: Commandment mode\r\n\r\nAnd I could find a definite pattern in whatever I had observed about myself and the others. \r\n\r\n<Now talk about:\r\nWe create the conditions that define when an outcome has been achieved.\r\nWhen we satisfy those conditions, thats when we say we have achieved what we wanted to.\r\nEx: How many of us brush our teeth every morning? You do realise that we have a choice every morning- to brush or not to brush. ‘\r\nHow do you know that it is time to brush your teeth? \r\nIt works like this- we have all created a map/ blueprint of what clean teeth looks, sounds and feels like. And we have accepted that when certain level of look, sound and feel is reached, thats when we call our teeth clean.\r\nSo those levels of look, sound and feel are the conditions that must be satisfied, in order to achieve the outcomes good dental hygiene.\r\n\r\nAgain get into certain small decisions that we take every day. Engage with the audience. Another opportunity to create breakthroughs and seed my program>\r\n\r\nRight, coming back to my story, my study and what I have learnt-\r\n\r\nI realised that every single one of us, who has taken important decisions (-and I’m talking about life level important) has followed a system or a process to overcome that difficulty. \r\n\r\nAnd today Im going to share as much of this systems as possible. Time is running out, so lets cover as much as we can.\r\n\r\nIn the past 6 months of study, I could decode definite four steps that every single one offs followed. Now, you must know that there were differences in each’s approach, because the context in which the decisions were taken were very different from each other. Ex: I had lost my job, Kash had lost 2 dear family members, somebody else was facing a bad business situation, some others a bad marriage. So it was obvious that the decision making process would vary slightly for each one. Even the time taken would vary. Some decided in an instant, some took a little more time. \r\n\r\n10 minutes (Minute 100)\r\n\r\nWhat was common was that they all followed 4 major steps. Let me explain by taking my own example:\r\n\r\nStep 1: The first thing I did was to realise that NEED to make a decision. I had a one year old kid, and till now both my wife and I were working, so double salary. Suddenly, my contribution to the household was taken out. My realisation that I needed to get back on my feet immediately was the trigger that spurred me into action.\r\n\r\nStep 2: The second thing I did was to get clear about what I wanted to do. Entrepreneurship had been on the back of my mind for the past 3- 4 years. A week after I lost my job, I realised that this was my golden opportunity to make my dreams of being an entrepreneur a reality. \r\nNext, I got specific about what kind of entrepreneur I wanted to become, as in, what would my business be.\r\nSince I had joined the college with the aim of giving back, I decided that I would start with Career counselling, ie, helping students decide a career path suitable for them.\r\n\r\nStep 3: The third thing I did was to work out how I would be going about it. Because along with knowing what you want, it is equally important to know how you’re going to achieve it. Otherwise its just a wish. \r\n\r\nStep 4: The last thing I did was to evaluate the results I was getting from the previous three steps. I am a firm believer of, change the action, never the outcome. \r\nIn this case my outcome was to become a successful entrepreneur. I did the career counselling for a few days, realised it was not something that the students needed. So I changed tracks- I started a toy rental service. I ran that for a year, made a decent amount of money, but suddenly lost all my customers. So I changed tracks again- I started freelancing as a content writer. In this profession I realised that for someone to be in India and give quality content is meaningless. To really make good money easily, I needed to be either in the US or UK, and have a western name. I made good money as a content writer, but the amount of work was enormous, because not a single client accepted my work the first time around. The number of revisions were crazy. So then I changed tracks again- I started training people in IELTS because my English was good. I made some money there too, but got sick of the politics being played at my training organisation. \r\n\r\nThroughout the journey, I have never changed the outcome, I have changed the action plan. And thats a belief- keep the outcome fixed. If something isn’t working, do something else. Keep moving.\r\n\r\nSo these are the four steps. Every single one of my friends has followed these steps to keep moving in their lives. \r\n\r\nI wish I could go a little ore deeper into this, but we really are running out of time. So is it ok if I make you an offer?\r\n\r\n\r\nMinute 110 to 120: Offer\r\n\r\nThe offer I have for you is this:\r\n\r\nI will give you complete access to my amazing 4 step system that allows you to take better decisions faster and more consistently.\r\n\r\nSo what do you get in this system?\r\n\r\nThis system is a full 3 month program.\r\nYou will access to 6 tools. And each of them is designed to improve the quality and speed of your decisions.\r\nAdditionally you will have 8 assignments to submit. Again, each assignment adds on a new level of competency in your decision making.\r\nYou will get access to 7 action guides. These are meant to support you during the 3 months and act as steady reminders that you have work to do.\r\nYou will get 4 conference calls, in which I will come live and share learnings pertaining to that particular step.\r\nYou will get invited to 4 meet ups, during which we will meet at a central part of the city, and I will share some information that will bring about transformation, we will play games that will reinforce your learning.\r\n\r\nSo thats the entire system that you will get access to. \r\n\r\nNow normally I price this system at 90,000. But thats not the price today. Im giving it away at a crazy discount. Its a truly ridiculous price. And ill tell you the price after I tell you the bonuses I’m giving away completely free.\r\n\r\nSo for 90,000, which is not 90,000 today you get my complete 3 month system, and, you get:\r\n\r\nMy audio program worth 20,000 free.\r\nMy video program worth 20,000 free.\r\nA free copy of my book worth 800.\r\nAccess to a membership site- now what is a membership site? It is an online portal into which only a select few are allowed to enter. This group of people are committed to other’s development as much as they are to their own. In fact, one of the criteria to be a part of this membership site is that you have to demonstrate your commitment to improve others. \r\nNow, why do people pay lakhs and lakhs of rupees to clubs like Cricket club, Bowring institute, Bangalore club of Golf club? Is it for the food? NO! Its for the networking, its for the business opportunities. Its for the opportunity to get like minded people and do something to make a difference.\r\nAnd my membership site has been created with the same purpose. It is to bring together a group of like minded people who will collectively work to help other people make better decisions faster and more consistently.\r\nNow why am I doing all this? Giving away a crazy discount on my program, giving so many bonuses free? Its because I want to enable as many people as possible make better decisions faster and more consistently.\r\n\r\nSo a membership into an elite club costs lakhs; I think 30,000 is a really reasonable price to put on membership to such a club. I actually charge that much, for those who don’t attend my program.\r\n\r\nSo access to my membership site worth 30,000 is completely free.\r\n\r\nWhere are we now, full access to my program worth 90,000 (which is not 90,000 only for today.\r\nAudio program worth 20,000\r\nVideo program worth 20000\r\nMy book worth 800\r\nMembership site worth 30,000\r\n\r\nAnd, and and not to forget. You get the entire program in a DVD format, all the tools, action guides, assignments everything. So that you can take it to someone you think is in need of it, and teach them the same thing that you have learnt. And I don’t think you can put a price on that- to actually contribute to improving somebody else’s life.\r\n \r\nSo you get all of these bonuses worth 71000 for free, along with an incalculable contribution to somebody else’s life. \r\n\r\nThe price of my program was 90,000. Its at a huge discount only today and only for the first fifteen participants. \r\n\r\nThe price is……….. 50,000/-\r\n', 0),

(335, 0, 2, 2, 'I will be telling stories from my life and also my friends to make the audience get the outcomes I have mentioned above.\r\nStory 1:\r\nLet me tell you one of my friend\'s experience. Working in a IT company with big hopes to become Rick and working hard every single day burning lot of extra hours at office just for a couple of % as hikes came to know about stock market as a huge opportunity to earn.\r\nHe quickly opened a trading account with one of the broking firm and invested around 50000 as capital. But he has no knowledge about stock market and all he believed was that the analyst will help him do high profitable trades.\r\nHe used to check news occasionally. Once he saw the company Amtek Auto making highs every single day and it skyrocketed like anything. The share price has reached around 250 and he thought it is going to continue the trend and thought of investing the amount and get at least 10% and get out of the stock. \r\nHe invested the entire 50000 buying the stock at around 250. Unfortunately from the very next day the tock started falling from that level. He was thinking it was just a small correction and it would rebounded again. But to his bad luck, it kept falling, further and further. He now decided to hold it few more months and he was confident that it would reach the same level and go up in few months. But it kept falling further and further. The Stock price came to 25. He lost 90% of the investment. He now lost hopes on this stock and also on the stock market. \r\nHe was broke and depressed. The amount which was saved little and little every month got vanished in just few months.\r\nLearnings:\r\nI had a discussion with him once and asked him what is the actual problem?\r\n•	He said there was a sudden bad news over night\r\n•	The stock revenue and profit were not good\r\n•	The whole market was in to downtrend\r\n•	Global scenario was bad\r\nI told him that these are not the actual reason for your loss. It is YOU who is responsible for your loss and I want you to understand that.\r\n1. Do you have any basic knowledge of Stock Market and how it operates?\r\n2. Do you practice you investing and trading with a structured process?\r\n3. Did you learn the discipline and patience that is mandatory while dealing in Stock Market?\r\n4. Do you know the basic rules to do predictions in Stock picks?\r\n\r\nAnd his answer was NO for all of the above. \r\nThen it is very difficult to make money in Stock Market.\r\nOnly when a person i able to say YES to all of the above questions he can start investing and trading in Stock Market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestionnaire\r\nI will share a set of questionnaires to the participants to increase the pain points\r\nDo you have a proper money management? What are the things that are lacking in you to manage your money?\r\nWhat is stopping you from becoming a millionaire?\r\nWhat are the big hurdles that you face when it comes to investing?\r\n  \r\nStory 2: My Story – How I became successful in making consistent profits \r\nHello Everyone, let me tell you a little about myself and how my journey started.\r\nI\'m an average student in school and in my college and like you all, I had a lot of financial issues for my education and I completed it by taking bank loans. During this tough period of time, I understood the importance of money and I believed that money can give you a comfortable life. I got a job in an IT firm after engineering and got around 18K pm. But I always dreamt of achieving financial freedom but achieving it is not that easy. It cannot be achieved with my current job alone.\r\nI tracked a lot of business people and billionaires to understand how they achieved financial freedom. After intense research there was 2 things in common.\r\n\r\nSecondary Income and Passive Income\r\n\r\nI made a decision on that day that I should start finding ways of making secondary income and passive income. Buy How?\r\nI\'m not expert in any field to start making that money. So I started exploring on all the possible ways of making money.\r\n\r\n1. Created a website.\r\n2. Affiliate Marketing\r\n3. Teaching on some random subjects\r\n4. Various online money making methods etc\r\nBut nothing worked well for me.\r\n\r\nOne day I came to know from Economic Times about Stock Market and I can see many people earning huge in fact earning millions. I was shocked to read about these people. I read about alot more people until I completely believed that I too can make money in Stock Market and its not something fake.\r\nI started learning about Stock Market from that day and tried to put my learning in to practice. But I kept failing. But I never gave up, I understood that I need to learn more and practice more to succeed in Stock Market. I continued to learn with the hope that one day I will be successful.\r\nI understood that I cannot be successful if I don\'t have a system so I create a 4 stage system with all the learning I had so far and followed it no matter what.\r\nAnd I was able to make consistent profits in Stock Market and achieve success.\r\nIt has been 8 years and I\'m happy to be successful in Stock Market. I faced a lot of pain and challenges during these 8 years and I doesn\'t want everyone else to face those challenges.\r\nSo I started training people who are really serious about their life and have big dreams to achieve. I have created a 4 stage system which worked for me and many of my students to make consistent profits in stock market.\r\nOne of my students followed my system and made 32% in just 3 months which is amazing. I want to spread my knowledge and my 4 stage system to as many as possible and help people achieve their financial freedom.\r\nIn order for a person to achieve success in Stock Market, a system is very important to earn profits consistently which I will be able to provide you.\r\n\r\nOutcome:\r\n1.	A proper money management system\r\n2.	learn the system to trade for short term and medium term in Stock Market\r\n\r\nStory 3:\r\nI have a friend Arun and like every one else he too wants to become rich. He is 25 years old and he thought the only way to become rich is by increasing his salary. So he worked hard but he didn’t know that in order to become rich and achieve financial freedom earning is not enough.\r\nEvery year his salary got increased but he never was able to save any money. With increase in salary, his expenses too got increased so there was no proper savings.\r\nMost of us here are in the same situation. We feel that we need to increase our salary to become rich but you can never achieve financial freedom with that. One of the main reasons being when our salary increases we increase our expenses and not the savings. \r\nOne must have a proper money management system to achieve Financial Freedom. \r\nThe second most important is to have a proper investment techniques from which you make money from money.\r\nIn the case of Arun, I understood that he doesn’t have a money management system and has no investment techniques as well. So I offered my 3 month program “The Millionaire Trading Formula” through which \r\nHe learnt a proper money management system \r\nHe learnt my entire system on investment and trading in stock market from which he now earns consistent profits every month.\r\nHe is now able to manage his hard earned money and even invest and trade that money in Stock Market and make more money.\r\n\r\n', 0),

(982, 454474, 3, 2, 'Hi my name is Avinash! I take good decisions quickly and consistently. \r\nI remember a time when I was coming back from a 600 km roadtrip with my family. My kid, who was a baby then had a bad tummy, we were tired. We were also very hungry. We were trying to decide where to have our dinner. And like all family discussions, we got nowhere. It went on and on and on for almost 10 minutes! I was quiet the whole time. Finally I couldn\'t take it anymore, and said, \"We\'re going to Agarwal Bhavan. Its close by, clean and tasty.\" The moment I said that there was pin drop silence in the car. My decision ticked off all the boxes that we were talking about. \r\n\r\nAsk the audience- How many of you take decisions? How many don\'t take decisions? How many take decisions quickly? How many take forever to take a decision?\r\n\r\nMy career story:\r\n\r\nAsk the audience- How many of you have done engineering? How many non- engineering? How many of you decided that you wanted to pursue a particular education path and then actively went after it? For how many of you was the decision taken by someone other than yourself?\r\n\r\nSo I did my engineering, specialised in mechanical Engineering. And the reasoning for mechanical was that I could move into any field of study I wished. At that time, Infosys and Wipro were still hiring mechanical engineers. So we thought I could get hired by both engineering and non- engineering companies. Which, at that time, seemed to be a sound, logical reasoning. So it was decided that mechanical it would be!\r\n\r\nI was horrible at it. I hated every single class and lab. I just couldn’t understand what we were supposed to study, and how to study. In fact, my dad used to teach me after college. \r\n\r\nI stumbled and fumbled my way through the four years of Engineering, finally looking at the end point- and what is the end point of engineering? \r\n\r\nPLACEMENTS!!\r\n\r\nI didn’t make it through Infosys, or Wipro or HP or IBM or any of the 20 other companies that came to my college. \r\n\r\nTowards the end of the placement season, I got placed in Godrej. Actually I had another offer too- to work in a call centre, because that was the time they were booming. And I had to make a decision- earn more in a call centre, or do what my heart told me to. So I decided- I took up the sales job at Godrej.  And my profile was sales. I had just got my first job! I started with a salary of 10,000 per month, and I used to blow it all up. I had a very strange way of spending my money- I used to save it all up till the 20th, and spend everything before the 30th.\r\n\r\nI worked in Godrej for about 10 months. I was really bored with the job. I hated the fact that I struggled through 4 years of Engineering, and I mean really struggled through it, only to sell office furniture- tables, chairs and conference tables.\r\n\r\nSo I made a decision to change my industry completely. I wanted to work in a core engineering company. One of my colleagues had just done a high profile MBA from some college, and was pretty well connected. So I asked him if he knew someone in a core engineering company. He connected me to his friend in SKF. I contacted that friend and asked him if there were any opportunities. The only available opportunity was to attend a placement round at another college. \r\n\r\nHere was another dilemma- should I forgo the 10 months experience at Godrej and join as a fresher in SKF? Or continue to show up at a job I hated? Because I would have to join SKF as a fresher again and begin my career from scratch.\r\n\r\nSo I took a decision to attend the campus interview a second time and restart. \r\n\r\nYou see, I hated my job at Godrej that much. Which leads me to a question- how do you take decisions? \r\n\r\nFor example, lets take Bangalore traffic- how many would like to move out of Bangalore because of the traffic and infrastructure issues? How many would like to move out because moving out opens up a whole new range of possibilities?\r\n\r\nThere is actually a formula to this- which Ill cover in more detail a little later.\r\n\r\nNow I had a pretty good run at SKF, I worked there for almost 5 years. I was in Pune, just completed my year long training period. In my training period I was in the ADC at Bangalore, working on developing new products. In fact, I played a role in the development of the Royal Enfield speedometer. Till then, all the speedometers on bikes were driven by a cable. The new system that we developed used sensors- it was a far more accurate system, more efficient and would never break down. I can tell u more about it if time permits. After 6 months at ADC I moved to Pune where I was in charge of supervising the shop floor production of Hub bearings. These are the ones that you find inside the wheels of every single Maruti and Tata cars that are plying.\r\n\r\nAfter my training period, I was again faced with a decision to make- I had a choice of either continuing to work in Pune on the shop floor, or move to Coimbatore in a Sales role. \r\n\r\nI desperately wanted to come back to Bangalore, but I couldn’t. So I chose Coimbatore. BTW, the same formula which I spoke about earlier applies to this situation as well. \r\n\r\nI worked in Coimbatore for 2 years, and found an opportunity to come back to Bangalore. I came back, and decided that my resume needed to become more fancy. I decided that I needed to do an MBA. \r\n\r\nNow why did I take this decision? Because everyone else was doing an MBA. As my mentor says, every man and his dog have an MBA now. \r\n\r\nI started giving interviews as soon as I landed back to Bangalore- I went to Volvo, Exide, 3M, Timken and a few others I don’t recall. The person who took my interview at 3M soon resigned from his position and joined Honeywell. He remembered me from the interview. Especially because I had done well and had got an offer as well, which I didn’t take. He called me to join his team at Honeywell. Again, I had a decision to make, but this time it was a much easier decision- the salary being offered was 3 times what I was earning at SKF. So I jumped at the opportunity. \r\n\r\nTheres a formula to decision making here too, and yes, its the same as before.\r\n\r\nIn Honeywell I worked in sales for 2 years, then moved to something called Marketing Communications, a role in which I stayed for another 3 years. In my role I was responsible for conducting and managing events in which we would have our stall. The outcome was to increase our visibility to our target market and generate leads, which the sales team would later follow up on.\r\n\r\nI remember the first event that I managed. What a nightmare! I had to coordinate between the event organisers, the guys who would build our stall, get quotations, arrange for payments, oversee the stall construction. And coordinate with the internal guys to make sure the product samples moved on time. And this was in Mumbai, so the octroi issue. It was a crazy time!\r\n\r\nHowever, by the third event, I had developed my own system. It was a systematic 5 step process that I developed. I had check lists, time lines and email templates. By the fourth one, I did not have to work at it at all. All I had to do was run my system, and things would fall in place.\r\n\r\nBy now I had been working almost 12 years. And I had begun to feel that my career was going nowhere. I used to ask myself questions like, “Can I sustain this in the long run?”, “Is this what I really wanted to do?” \r\n\r\nBecause you see, our society has laid out a pretty good system for us. Finish 16 years of education, get a job, get another job, buy a car. By doing this, you become eligible in the marriage market. And what I had done in my career served this purpose. I fell in love with my wife, and there weren’t too many objections to get married. But now that that purpose had been served, what next?\r\n\r\nSo I decided to do something radically different. You see, I had been an active toastmaster for almost 10 years. So I wanted to teach, to train, to get in front of an audience and bring about transformation. \r\n\r\nI got the very same opportunity. I took up responsibility as a placement officer in an engineering college. In this position I arranged number of opportunities for the kids to start their career, I used to go out of my way to teach them the basics of effective communication and how to give interviews. I organised Yoga and meditation sessions in the college for them. It was my way of doing what I wanted to do, and to give back to society as well. I was living a dream.\r\n\r\nThen one day, the management of the college calls me to their cabin and says, “We have decided to relieve of your duties. Today is your last day in the college. Please submit your resignation letter.”\r\n\r\nIt was as if my entire identity had been taken away in 2 seconds. Whatever I had worked for, everything that I stood for, was just removed in an instant. I had gone from being somebody who mattered to a nobody. Now it didn’t matter if I slept all day, didn’t shower or got drunk in the morning. No one cared…\r\n\r\nI remember the scene vividly. I stepped out of the cabin confidently, but on the inside I was in shock. I walked a few steps, and some students were milling around. They saw me and wished me good morning. It was as if the sound was coming from somewhere far off, like it was muffled. I walked a few more steps and slumped into a chair meant for the visitors. I sat in silence for a few minutes. Too I bought myself together and went up to my office. From there I called my wife and dad and told them what had just happened. They tried to give me some advice, but I wasn’t listening. I typed out my resignation letter and went back to the principals chamber. I handed it over in silence, he took it in silence. I went back up to my cabin and began to pack my stuff. It all fit into a box, which I carried to my car. I got in, and drove off home.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I saw when I got home was my one year old son. The moment I saw him I felt a little better. I played with him for some time. \r\n\r\nThat evening, as I sat alone, I realised that this was the biggest decision I would have to make in my life- I had 2 choices- to sit around all day, mope and brood over what had happened, or to pick myself up again, start afresh and rebuild my career. \r\n\r\nSo I took the decision to rebuild it.\r\n\r\nSoon I started mentoring students about what career choices they had, how they should plan their career, a sort of career counselling. \r\n\r\nA few months later, I started a toy rental company- where I would give toys on rent on a fortnightly basis. \r\n\r\nA few more months later, I started freelancing as a content writer, too after I started conducting IELTS training classes. \r\n\r\nThat day, I took a decision to never ever give up on anything. And that has been the best decision I ever took. To keep that warrior spirit going, no matter what.\r\n\r\n\r\nETR:\r\n\r\nOne day I was chilling out at home. I was alone, and I was lost in my thoughts. My thoughts slowly drifted towards all the stories I just shared. As I was remembering the stories one by one, the realisation dawned in me. \r\n\r\nI realised that there was a common thread connecting all the stories. \r\n\r\nAnd that common thread was DECISIONS.\r\n\r\nIn my case, when I lost my job, I made a decision to pick myself up and rebuild my career.\r\n\r\nSame thing with Pranav.\r\n\r\nWith Kash too- she turned out to be the strongest among us! She decided that she cannot continue living like this. So she started working out, and started eating healthy. She dropped 20 kg in 2 years, and lost 10 years of age in the process.\r\n\r\nComing to the marriage horror stories-\r\n\r\nChethan decided within a few short weeks to move on. He decided that whats done is done. He attempted to make his marriage succeed, it didn’t work, time to move on. Today he is happily married.\r\n\r\nSandeep and Santosh too, decided to move on. He is actively looking for a suitable girl.\r\n\r\nThe last one, the Germany case- This was a very complicated case, because both husband and wife had German citizenship, their kid was also a German. He could neither leave, not stay back.\r\n\r\nHe decided that his immediate priority was to be able to move out of the country. So he had a discussion with his wife and she withdrew the complaint. They all went back to Germany within a week, and worked out their differences.\r\n\r\nThey both had decided that quitting and moving out of the marriage was not the solution. Instead they decided to stay together and accept each others differences. Its been 3 years now, and the entire family lies happily in Pune.\r\n\r\nMinute 71 to 75\r\n<>\r\n\r\nNow I dug deeper into these incidents, and tried to decode the exact process that all of us followed to get un- stuck and keep moving ahead. \r\n\r\nIt took me about 6 months, and in the process I wrote a book called Do. Decide. Repeat. I also created a whole bunch of videos and audios, and conducted interviews to see of everyone followed the same programming.\r\n\r\nWhat I learnt was a revelation. I realised that we are driven by decisions- from the smallest routine activity we do till the one off big things- it all boils down to decisions.\r\n\r\n<Now get into how we take the small decisions- Ex: we wear our clothes twice everyday, our decision to keep ourselves and hygienic and such small things.\r\nThen get into the bigger decisions like buying a house, a car, to change a job.\r\nAnother opportunity to create breakthroughs and seed my program>\r\n\r\nMinute 75 to 90\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinute 91 to 110: Commandment mode\r\n\r\nAnd I could find a definite pattern in whatever I had observed about myself and the others. \r\n\r\n<Now talk about:\r\nWe create the conditions that define when an outcome has been achieved.\r\nWhen we satisfy those conditions, thats when we say we have achieved what we wanted to.\r\nEx: How many of us brush our teeth every morning? You do realise that we have a choice every morning- to brush or not to brush. ‘\r\nHow do you know that it is time to brush your teeth? \r\nIt works like this- we have all created a map/ blueprint of what clean teeth looks, sounds and feels like. And we have accepted that when certain level of look, sound and feel is reached, thats when we call our teeth clean.\r\nSo those levels of look, sound and feel are the conditions that must be satisfied, in order to achieve the outcomes good dental hygiene.\r\n\r\nAgain get into certain small decisions that we take every day. Engage with the audience. Another opportunity to create breakthroughs and seed my program>\r\n\r\nRight, coming back to my story, my study and what I have learnt-\r\n\r\nI realised that every single one of us, who has taken important decisions (-and I’m talking about life level important) has followed a system or a process to overcome that difficulty. \r\n\r\nAnd today Im going to share as much of this systems as possible. Time is running out, so lets cover as much as we can.\r\n\r\nIn the past 6 months of study, I could decode definite four steps that every single one offs followed. Now, you must know that there were differences in each’s approach, because the context in which the decisions were taken were very different from each other. Ex: I had lost my job, Kash had lost 2 dear family members, somebody else was facing a bad business situation, some others a bad marriage. So it was obvious that the decision making process would vary slightly for each one. Even the time taken would vary. Some decided in an instant, some took a little more time. \r\n', 0),

(369, 346638, 3, 2, 'Since my program is all about breakups and how to come out it, my story revolves around love and relationships.\r\nSince childhood in my know I had been a good bully(by good bully I mean I use to bully those who use to bully the weak) since the time I could remember I have been solving issues of friends and kids who needed help from bullies, apart from this I was also called as cupid in my school as any guy who wanted to get a girl I was the one whom they use to come to and I can say I have 100% record of get the guy his girl. Since I was the bully for the bullies I use to attract boys more as friends than girls and since boys were comfortable around me most of them use end up proposing to me.\r\nI have a very very conservative parents, my dad dint liked love marriage at all, I remember my dad not talking or accepting one of my aunt (dad’s sister) because she had did love marriage. I love my dad so much that I decided not to fall in love before marriage, so any guy proposing to I use to turn them down.\r\nI was a very big fan of eternal love stories, I have grew up watching all the eternal love stories and always fantasised to have an eternal love story for myself. Since my love for dad was also very strong I promised myself not to fall in love before marriage. Im a very honest girl, a girl of my words if I promise something I make sure I do it, im not a girl who follow rules set by others, however never breaks the rules I have set for myself.\r\nAs we all know, true love just happens it cant be planned. When I was in my 11th standard there was a boy in my class, he was the stud of the school, heartthrob of every girl, initially because of his attitude, over smartness and I dint knew him so I use to hate him, later when I came to know about his nature, his character I felt like the man of my dreams  got a face and he had all the qualities I dreamt to be in my man and unknowingly I fell in love with him and I proposed to him, he said he cant marry me, however we can be together, lets not think about future, now I was so sure about myself and the kind of commitment I will be giving him as I knew very well what he was looking for in a relationship, so I thought my love will change his decision.\r\nIm have a golden skin, so I had this insecurity in my head that since my skin is dark brown he no way will marry me as even his parents wont accept me because every mother wants a fair & beautiful girl for her son, so having this thought in mind and when he said he cant marry me, I confirmed it yes this is the only reason and I never asked him the reason why he said so. Meanwhile he use to tell me people keep telling that he can do better then me why is he with me, I don’t deserve him, so my insecurity kept increasing, I was so blind in his love, I thought he was just sharing everything with me.\r\nOnce he came into my life I never gave importance to anyone, I thought if he is with me I don’t need anyone else. My mom always use to tell us, a good wife is someone who will cook like a mother in the kitchen, behave like a friend in life and be a girlfriend in bedroom and I was everything to him, as he himself said this to me. 1st seven years were like paradise we were the happiest people together, though he never accepted me as his girlfriend in front of his friends and family, we had the strongest connection that even if he use to think somthing I could read his thoughts like literally, he had once told me that, pravi no matter how I treat you, what I say to you, you should always be with me as you are the only one who understands me, and to this I promised him not matter what happens, what you do or say, I wont leave your side until n unless you will say to me praveena I don’t need you in my life please go away, till then I will stay by your side.\r\nThen came a girl in his life, who was very fair, beautiful, way more confident than me, more expressive than me, and they started seeing eachother, when I came to know about it I asked him and he said you now me im just flirting, I never get serious with anyone and I believed him, then slowly slowly he started picking fights with me for no reason, & I being a patient girl, I reacted very less, still he kept fighting with me and started maintain distance from me.\r\nThis girl came to know about me and she came to fight with me for the and we had a very bad fight, which I thought not to tell him as why to bother him when I handled it, however that girl went and told him in such a way that, I was the one who initiated the fight and she had nothing to do with it, listening to it he came furious to me that why I did such an act, after me explaining him the whole scenario, he said “you are say something she is saying something else whom should I believe?” This was the 1st time ever I really got hurt realizing the fact that he don’t trust me, after this incident this girl kept doing weird stuffs and made him think im the bad girl and I stopped giving explanation as I felt no matter what I say he wont believe me, there’s no point explaining.\r\n2009 was the 1st time when he said to me enough is enough praveena I don’t want to be with you anymore, after this for a whole year he dint speak to me, it was a shock to me I dint even understood what happened and why, I kept asking him what was the reason, I never got an answer for the same. \r\nWhole 2009 I was under depression, the only thing I remember doing that time was trying to contact him and talk to him which dint happen as he had blocked me everywhere, I lost my smile, confidence, couldn’t speak to anyone. I loved him so much that I never ever wanted to tell anything bad about him to anyone, thinking what if someday we get back together and these people wont respect him, and for me his respect was very important, he was my pride. The fact that I wasn’t able to talk to him and keeping all this inside me was killing me everyday, so one day I thought why not end the pain, as it was getting unbearable with each passing second.\r\nI wanted to end my life, I was in my room thought to hang myself, when I was just about to do it, I thought about my family, as I had said I come from a very conservative family so is my native place, where if an unmarried girls commits suicide no matter what the truth is, people will only say bad about her, like she was pregnant that’s why she killed herself or something like that and I have a kid sis who had to get married, if I ended my life I will be taking away the opportunity from her for leading a good life. My dad he loves us like crazy, how could I hurt him and for the 1st time I shared my pain with my elder sister and my cousin, still I dint tell them I wanted to end my life because I was heart broken, the reason I told them was me failing in my career and I cant handle it. they took it casually and made joke about it to make me feel better, it only made me feel worse, a couple of days later I repeated the episode of trying to end my life, again couldn’t do it only this time I dint tell anyone about it.\r\nIn 2010 I was to taken to kerala to see a boy to get married, there my horoscope was shown to a pandit whom my family respects a lot, as till date whatever he had said was always been true, he said this girl has had a heartbreak and she will never get married. My mom with tears in her eyes came to me and said, this is what the pandit has said is it true, do you love someone, you tell me his name I will ask him to marry you and I dint want anyone to force to be with me so I denied everything. However it put me into thinking, do I want such a life, not getting married is ok, but till when am I going to cry over something I cant control and I decided I will get out of it.\r\nI thought of occupying myself so I don’t think much about him, so I took a job under a designer, after a year he himself called me saying he forgave me and we can be friends, when he wanted me he use to be nice and when the need was over again pick fight on silly matter and stop talking to me, so for the next 7years he was coming going from my life in the gap of every 6months. In the meanwhile I started working on myself like worked on the way I presented myself, started doing yoga, meditation, joined self help programs and it took me 7years to finally transform myself into a better version of me with whom Im madly in love and wont let anyone to hurt me again. Im so confident today that where ever I go people end up wanting to work with me, I have created my personality so much so that when people see me they see a lady with pride and powerful persona. My friends keep asking my how I did it, when I tell my story to people everybody say, looking at you no one can say you have been through such an experience, as nobody believes I could be so emotional.\r\n', 0),

(371, 346638, 5, 2, 'Story for data point 1\r\nWe all know we are here to talk about break-ups so am I, even I was in love with a guy for 14years, in this 14years we brokeup and patched up many times, however the 1st time when my ex told me “enough is enough I don’t want to be with you praveena” I was shattered I went under depression for 1 whole year, he was my pride & I was so much in love with him that I never wanted to share the details of what happened between us with anyone as I never wanted anyone to say bad about him. Keeping my pain within me and not sharing with anyone just kept killing me. After gathering all my courage here im today to share my pain with you all, as we say sharing happiness doubles the joy and sharing pain lessens it.\r\nOutcome in this is to let them know it is good to talk about your pain and it will only make them feel good and light inside them.\r\n\r\nStory for data point 2\r\nWhen my ex told me the 1st time he doesn’t want to be with, I was shattered, I felt like he took my heart out of my body put in a grinder and grinded it which I cant even put back together. I tried asking him what went wrong, what can I do to make it right but he never ever spoke to me, I use cry myself to sleep, each passing second use to kill me, the pain was so much that I could feel an emptiness inside me, somebody trying to choke me to death and then one day I decided lets end this pain once and for all. now I have always been a people pleasing person, I use love to see people smiling because of me, being such a person how could I just think about myself, I was standing on my bed, with a chair on top of it with a saree designed by me tied to the fan, crying and crying like I would burst, just when I put my head into the hanging hole I thought about my parents my dad loves us like anything and he is equally sensitive like me the only difference is he never shows, my kid sister had to get married if me an unmarried girl will commit suicide, people will talk ill about me which might effect my sisters life, thinking all this I came down put the chair back.\r\nThis is wasn’t enough for after somedays I had an argument with my ex, not exactly argument he was blaming me for everything and I was trying to explain him which he wasn’t listening to, so after talking to him again I tried to end my life, which I couldn’t do it thinking about my family. Later after I started working on bringing me back to life, once I started looking to forward to live my life for me, i realized what a waste it would had been if I would have ended my life. A couple of years later I heard jiah khan suicide case because of a man in her life, then I heard about pratyusha bannerji suicide case again the same reason, I was angry, it made me furious, I was like why, why are these girls so mad to give away their lives like this that too for people who don’t even deserve it, and it came to my mind if only I could have had a chance to  speak with them I could have guarantee changed their thought about it and that’s how I decided to help save precious and beautiful lifes, as it not worth it to give away for someone who don’t deserve us. \r\n\r\nStory for data point 3\r\nWe have common friends since he was my childhood love so our school friends were same, we all planned to go to goa everybody wanted to go by train and my ex loves driving so he was adamant to go by road he lives in Mumbai n my friends in pune so he wanted to drive down, now neither my friends were ready to give up neither him, so me being his friend asked my if he wanted me to join him for drive, he said yes so I flew all the way from delhi to Mumbai, a day before we had to leave, now the day I arrived he was very nice to me we a had a good time, I cooked for him things were all good, the day we had to leave he came to know that his girlfriend is also in goa, he told me that and I was ok because now I was just a friend to him, but he got nervous what if his girlfriend will come to know me and him came alone driving all the way from Mumbai to goa when she knows I was his strongest relationship, so as usual he started picking fights with me and as usual I went into my shell I dint speak the whole way even if I tried he lashed on me and that when I regretted me doing a favour for him not worth it.\r\nOutcome- everybody goes through good and bad in live, we just need to learn to accept it, learn from and move forward.\r\n\r\nStory for data point 4\r\nMy ex had gone to London for his MBA and I was doing my fashion schooling from delhi so he was here for vacation, I dint had a car then because I was a collage student staying away from my parents and he only travels in car he don’t like public transport, he was at my place and we decided to go for lunch at new friends colony market one of posh area of delhi, since it’s the posh area the crowd coming there is of that level, so he said to lets go there for lunch, when we will be over from lunch, you wait there only I will go to my uncle’s house who stays in new friends colony get the car n come pick you, I said just to tease him, cool while you go get the car I will flirt with guys over there, hearing this he murmured, yes sure, you can try to flirt with, they will flirt with you or not cant say, so I asked as if I dint heard him, I said sorry what did you say, he said nothing and since im already insecure about my skin color I dint want to listen clearly so I dint asked again. He kept doing such kinda things to me which kept breaking my self confidence, which took me 7years to gain back.\r\nOutcome- everybody does the same mistake of giving away everything for the person we care, and they take it for granted, however its good to include their priorities in your priority list however make sure it don’t disturb your priorities, accept your partner in your life without loosing your individuality.\r\n', 0),

You will have a 2 days session a month for the next 3months, you will be given exercises to do at home which will be supervised directly by me.\r\nThe bonuses im offer you are:-\r\nYou will be given my personal no. so that if you feel you want to talk to someone who just listen to you and not give unnecessary advice or comments or judge you, you can call me anytime you want, and speak with me for an hour to share your feelings, emotions and thoughts with me, which will be absolutely confidential. \r\nFor this I usually charge 5000/hr which you will be getting free for the next 3months.\r\n \r\nLets assume you want to talk to me atleast 3 or 4 times a week\r\nWhich is 5000*4(days)= 20000/-(this is for a week)\r\nSo in a month 20000*4(weeks)= 80000/-(a month)\r\nNow 80000*3(months)= 2,40,000(3months) this you are getting for free\r\n\r\nI will personally call you for one-to-one mentoring call every week. Now you will ask how is this different from you calling me. When you call me I will be listening to you without commenting or advising, I will be understanding your feelings and emotions, so when I call you to give my advice it will absolutely curated as per your personality. For example if we take encouragement there are 2types of it\r\nOne is positive encouragement, where you remind others on how good they are at things in a positive way.\r\nSecond is negative encouragement, where if a person say he cant do something, you reaffirm “yes offcourse you cant do it” and this words could trigger him, “oh! You think I cant do it, no wait n watch how I do it”.\r\nSo my mentoring will as per your personal emotional trigger. For this I charge 5000/hr which again you will be getting free for next 3months\r\n5000*4= 20000/-(a month)\r\n20000*3= 60000/-(for 3months) you will get for free.\r\n\r\nA personal shopping with me, which I charge 20000 a day which you will be getting absolutely free.\r\n\r\nSo you are getting bonus worth \r\n2,40,000+60,000+20,000= 3,20,000/- for freee.\r\n', 0),

(376, 204435, 3, 2, 'Here is how my story & my ETR would go.\r\n\r\nMy name is Ravneet and I come from a middle class family. During my childhood, I used to be just ok or just above average in my school and college days but yes sports always fascinated me and I really wanted to do something in that and make a career out of it which unfortunately I could not do because of our family situation during my growing up years. When I was about 10 years old, an incident/a tragedy happened in my life which completely changed me as a person overnight and from a kid who was like any other child at that age, I suddenly felt like I have grown up. And from that day for the next 10 years, I had faced challenges and obstacles which were completely beyond the capability to handle for a young child.\r\n\r\nI am sure you all will agree that the teenage years are probably one of the best years of anybody’s life, right?? where you make lots of friends, hang out with them, you have almost no responsibilities whatsoever, you get pampered a lot by your parents and essentially you do get what you want. But my story was written exactly the opposite.\r\n\r\nI had to support my family not only financially, emotionally but protect my family from the societal perspective as well and I was struggling to do all of that, I mean I was really really struggling. So I used to go to the school in the morning and once I am back, I used to run our shop which was into electronics goods and stuff along with my mom so that became my daily routine for almost all of my teenage years and also during the time when I was preparing for my competitive exams for engineering and doing MBA later on.\r\n\r\nSometime during this journey one fine day I realized that I cannot handle all of these responsibilities, pressure, stress at a young age until and unless I become very very strong and that was the point I drifted towards taking care of myself first, taking care of my body first and I started this journey of physical fitness to completely transform the way I look at and live my life and with time I realized how physical fitness and mental toughness are correlated to each other.\r\n\r\nToday when I am standing here in front of you, I am on a mission to be able to help a million people in next 10 years in transforming them not only physically by becoming fitter than they would have ever imagined themselves to be but also make them acquire the mental toughness of a hulk to achieve whatever they set their minds to… So today I am going to share with you a complete system, the system known as ‘Mind-Body connection blueprint’ which is easy and effortless to implement.\r\n\r\n', 0),

(378, 204435, 5, 2, 'Data point 1: Conventional myths regards to fitness\r\n\r\nStory: Through a written exercise. All participants to answer the below questions honestly.\r\n\r\nWhat challenges or obstacles you face today at this point in time in becoming a fitter person, in becoming a person who is extremely comfortable with your health and body?\r\n\r\nProbable answers: Not have enough time, too tired to workout, lack of knowledge, unable to control cravings etc.\r\n\r\nWrite 3 specific problems or limitations you will encounter if you are overweight/underweight?\r\n\r\nProbable answers: Low self esteem, low energy, mental stress etc.\r\n\r\nIn what ways being physically unfit can affect a person’s other areas of their life?\r\n\r\nProbable answers: Self confidence, negative emotions, lack of focus, ability to take decisions gets reduced with low self esteem etc.\r\n\r\nBasis above answers, I would ask the following questions and prove the point.\r\n\r\nCan anybody tell me whatever challenges/problems they have spoken has got to do more with your body or with your mind??\r\n\r\nWhere do you think the limitations exist??\r\n\r\nWhat do you think could be the solution to these problems?\r\n\r\nWhy do you think an unhealthier body leads to unhealthier mind which ultimately leads to lack of self confidence in your abilities, lack of focus, your ability to take decisions gets reduced, your energy levels drop, your productivity goes for a toss etc.\r\n\r\nThe truth is for long people have been made to believe the conventional lies related to physical fitness and how one needs to work out hours and hours in the gym or need to have the scientific knowledge on fitness to be able to transform their body.\r\n\r\nIt’s a big fat LIE.\r\n\r\n‘More than your body, your mind does 99% of the job’\r\n\r\nEverything that you think, every emotion you experience and every action you take is controlled with the way your mind is wired. And that’s exactly what my system ‘Mind-body connection blueprint’ talks about in my long term program.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a perfect body, if you are looking for a healthier lifestyle, if you are looking to improve your relationships, if you are looking to make faster & better decisions, if you are looking to increase your energy levels, if you are looking for laser sharp focus and improved communication then first you need to work on your MIND and everything else follows.\r\n\r\nOutcome: Breaking the myth that the need to work hard in gym or not having the required knowledge is stopping them to start their fitness journey rather it is the limiting beliefs in their minds which is stopping them to become fit.\r\n\r\nData point 2: Too difficult and challenging to acquire their dream physical shape.\r\n\r\nStory: I will address the above data point by explaining a story of my friend who used to think the same and had difficulty in making fitness a part of his lifestyle effortlessly. Here goes the story.\r\n\r\nI will share a story of one of my friend. His name is Sahil.\r\n\r\nHe is one guy who has been a very close friend of mine since the time I came to Mumbai and it’s been almost 4 years now. The best part about him is that whatever he puts his mind and soul into, he actually gets the work done which is good.\r\n\r\nHe is also into fitness since last few years but he wasn’t that regular. So essentially there was no schedule of working out, no concentrated focus on what to eat n what not to eat, how to treat your body well. All in all a very random approach towards fitness which obviously did not yield any results.\r\n\r\nOne day, he came up to me and told me that he has this problem of not being a regular in the gym and he cannot wake up in the morning even if he wants to. So every evening, he used to promise himself of waking up at a certain time and get ready for the gym but as soon as the alarm rings, he used to hit the snooze button and that habit of his was not only hampering his objective of regularly working out but he also started procrastinating some of his other decisions in his life.\r\n\r\nThis is what happens when you do not have a system in place.\r\n\r\nOnce I realized what exactly he was struggling with, I started applying my methods of working on how to create that change and he did not believe at all how it yielded results for him almost in no time.\r\n\r\nSo this is what exactly he did by applying the techniques of my system.\r\n\r\n1st morning….as soon as the alarm rings…. he woke up n then again went back to sleep…\r\n\r\n2nd morning…. he woke up, wore his gym clothes….and took it off and again went back to sleep…\r\n\r\n3rd morning…he again wakes up…wore his gym gear…. went to the door of the house…. turned around…came back n again went to sleep…\r\n\r\n4th morning…. he woke up…. went to the gym but did not enter…came back….then went back to sleep…\r\n\r\n5th morning…he woke up…. went to the gym…. entered inside the gym but didn’t work out…. came back and went to sleep…\r\n\r\n6th morning…. what do you think would have happened??? \r\n\r\nNow he became so used to the pattern which he developed in his morning ritual in last 5 days that on the 6th day without any effort or push he could easily follow the routine n work out. The pattern of being irregular in his morning workout which was going on for months could easily be changed by using my system and that’s exactly what each one of you can do in your respective lives.\r\n\r\nPeople have this big misconception that acquiring their dream physical shape or breaking certain patterns in one’s life is the most difficult thing to do and somehow they start convincing themselves in their minds and believe it to be true.\r\n\r\nThat’s exactly what happens with people who are overweight/underweight and do not see any hopes of building a body/physique that they can be comfortable with.\r\n\r\nOutcome: To make people realize that by creating rituals in their day to day life over a period of time with regards to fitness will make them acquire their dream body effortlessly & easy.\r\n\r\nData point 3: Mental block of not having enough self-belief to do things in mind first.\r\n\r\nStory: By quoting an example of Usain bolt here. Here goes the story.\r\n\r\nDo you guys know who Usain bolt is??\r\n\r\nYes, the 3 times consecutive 100m & 200m olympic champion….\r\n\r\nWhen he won gold last year in Rio Olympics, he went for a press conference after the event and in that press conference all the journalists from around the world asked him only one question and that question was ‘How do you manage to win every single time you set foot on the track, how is that even humanly possible’\r\n\r\nDoes anybody know what did he answered??\r\n\r\nHe said…\r\n\r\nI don’t win on the day of the race….I win during the period of 4 years when I am practicing day in day out….\r\nHe says, when I go there on the track….I just go there to accomplish in reality what I have already accomplished in my mind…..and that’s what the power of the human mind is…..\r\n\r\nYou talk about sportspersons, entrepreneurs, famous n accomplished people from any profession, they just do everything what they want to do in their minds first and then it just happens in reality and that’s what I have been able to discover during my journey of ‘Mind-body’ connection….\r\n\r\nOutcome: The power of Mind-Body connection to visualize things in their minds on what results they are after and how by first achieving goals in their minds will also make it happen in reality too. \r\n', 0),

Criticism : with definition and how it creates the belief system ( it makes children believe there is something wrong with them). Also examples (language used)\r\n\r\n2.	Defensiveness : defensiveness is used to protect against feeling blamed or attacked. \r\n\r\n3.

Working together to create clarity, an unstoppable mindset and a proven path for success is where I do my best work. These are millionaires in the making. My name is Sarita and I am a Business Power Coach\r\nI am on a mission to help 10,ooo business owners transform their small businesses to large in next five years.\r\nIn last 6 years of being a trainer and Coach I have helped over 5000 entrepreneurs and almost 50 small /medium sized businesses take their business to the next level.\r\n My programs transform people and individuals achieve awesome results and higher profits. \r\n I am born and brought up in Delhi. I always had dreams!! I studied Business Economics for 5 years followed by working with many organisations like CII, FICCI, SREI Infrastructure Finance, Amity, NYCS, NIESBUD for 8 years. How many of you have heard of CII/ FICCI?\r\nIn most organisations I worked I dealt with companies from small sizes to big, understand their features, challenges and small as well as large level. \r\nThere was always job dissatisfaction in corporate career, anyone in the room who felt same?\r\nthen I thought I would try something different and joined a Government organisation. I was Chief Consultant in a national level institution of the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), Govt of India which promotes Entrepreneurship across India. That was very challenging, a competent person in a govt organisation is not welcome. That too woman\r\nWhile training entrepreneurs from more than 55 countries at NIESBUD I created some cutting edge programs for Indian entrepreneurs like “How to raise Finance”, “EDP on Solar Energy” which were extremely successful. The exposure of sectors such as Energy, Climate Change, Education, Health, Research and Infrastructure in my corporate career helped me in guiding people to become entrepreneurs. I became a trainer and consultant to SMEs there and did really well for 3 years. Adding value to Entrepreneurs and consulting in their businesses gave me immense satisfaction and happiness. I finally found out what I love. I love to make entrepreneurs successful!! I also realized that I have spirit and instincts of an entrepreneur in me, that is why I never enjoyed working for others. The creativity and drive to lead never allowed me to enjoy systems created by others. \r\nFrom there started my journey of driving companies. You know what despite of so much knowledge, right partners and capital things did not work well. That was a like big thing for me, when we felt helpless we sat down and thought about why, what etc. for me, I started feeling a vacuum I could nt take it easily. I had put a lot of stake that time. 6 months I was hopeless, then I started going out attend events and in one such event I met one of the leading entrepreneurs of today. I asked him, how he made it and then went on to research more and talk to more people. I understood what did not work and created a plan. Followed that plan and next 6 months we bounced back. We are one of the most successful companies today for Skill paid training and training MSMEs by international methodology.\r\nToday, I have two established companies Redefine S&LP and Evoke Inspiring Lives which a mission to empower women entrepreneurs to reach all their goals. People started looking   upto me and that’s when I designed my systems to deliver to others. \r\n\r\nLast 6 years as a trainer and business coach have been immensely satisfying. That’s about me, I love to be around people like you who have choosen the path less travelled by, people who are strong headed, determined and who make choices which aren’t made by the average.\r\n\r\n', 0),

Though she goofed off in her first year, she took design seriously in her second year, and also took up a part-time job in a rug store at the age of 18. ‘Baggit’ was meant to be ‘bags with attitude,’ also inspired by Michael Jackson’s Beat It! She started off with canvas and then synthetic leather; with one shop at Kemp’s Corner and then a nationwide chain featuring innovatively designed bags and accessories.\r\nHow many ladies in this room, have a business idea?\r\nHow many do not?\r\nYou know a lot of time I stumble upon people who would want to become entrepreneurs and will have a business idea which cannot pull customers. It is so surprising because you can not run a business profitably if people do not pay for your idea. In my business planning workshops I ask ppl to find out all the possibilities for which they will be paid and opportunities which should fetch a market on its own. It saves them a lot of time and effort at a later stage.\r\nGame 1: Think about an idea/ product you have / if you do not have create one, write what is that you may like to build on.\r\nTake 15 minutes to write an idea and mention 3 strong points as per you, why someone may pay you for it.\r\nCreate a group of 4, present your idea and convince other 3 group members to buy it if they would be target market.\r\nConclusion: Our ideas might be great, they might be unique to us, our thought process may be different but creating a business venture means, finding people who will pay for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nData point # 2\r\nDream without crystal clear path is vain\r\nStart with an exercise – while coming to this seminar what all you did?

Because you knew the steps. You could plan, you could forsee how it would be like? \r\nWhat if you did not receive my email with venue? What would have happened? What if you did not get a transport? What was your mission before reaching here?\r\nEverything which is in system is easy to execute. While doing your business despite of uncertainities, you can make it predictable and convenient by making a plan. Making it a practise.\r\nWhat your vision and mission? Is it far sighted? Even though you have vision/idea/business, how many of you are clear on all steps and stages you need to be through. \r\nWhat challenges you face in achieving your dreams?\r\nWould anyone like to share?\r\nWhat if I tell you, to do them now what you feel are the challenges?\r\nWho has a clear path? What happens when you have a clear path\r\nI am a great fan of saying “Failing to plan is planning to fail” you know what happens in most businesses?, people do not plan their success. I am honest in saying that, 95% small businesses fail TO complete 5 years of business. Research findings say 60% of that is because of lack of strategic plan and direction.

She wanted to start something of her own however had no idea how to do that. She participated in my workshop and after going back home she put everything aside. Soon she found a friend as a business partner and very soon even before finishing MBA she opened Sandwedges her first eating joint for healthy sandwiches and other stuff. Because while working with her I realized her dream as a child was to have a food outlet as she cooked very well. We started working on her first restaurant which did very well, later she opened 2 more restaurants in few months and now is proud owner of 3 in NCR.

I suggested her to attend my power session. She came and we discussed about her experiences, skills and interest areas. She mentioned she wanted to do something different in life. I had designed a workshop on solar energy that time,I asked her to join it and learn something new. She did that program and later worked with me on my one year program KYSS . she owns one of the leading solar lantern businesses in india. You remember Uttarakhand tradegy this woman supplied more than 2000 lanterns to govt and people there. She met me after that and guess what she told me, I always wondered what keeps you motivated to work with people like me, I have felt same after supplying these lanterns.

SWOT is a tool if learnt properly it will help you forever at each stage of business. How many of you have ventured into business the idea you are pursuing after Market Research. Have you ever wondered why every few months few advertisements by some great companies change? Because they these companies invest huge amount of money in market research, in reading buyers patterns, learning what consumers like, what they don’t, what they are ready to pay for, what they aren’t. it helps them improvise their branding strategies or marketing campaigns.

Even if we don\'t choose to make them, they are still always made for us.

(487, 244797, 3, 2, 'My story :-  From childhood I was fond of studies and acquiring knowledge and was also brialliant in my academic years. I was topper in my HSC  boards in my whole caste and was awarded with a gold medal by my caste for my achievements. I completed my graduation and further I wanted to become a chartered accountant, but I have to end  up my studies because of financial background and my parents wanted me to get married as they believed that a girl has to serve her family so its of no use to study further. I surrender to their wish and their belief and got married. I am not blaming my parents for that because they did what was best knowledge available to them. As a parent of three daughters they wanted me to get married at proper age so that the society won’t blame them for not getting their daughter married. My in-laws was from a well to do family running their own successful  pharmaceutical business. They also didn’t wanted me to work outside or join their business. Being a conservative family they believed that its not advisable for a daughter-in –law to move out of the family for a work. As the society will not accept it. Again I surrendered myself. I was happily living a life of a housewife,taking care of my family their health ,fulfilling their need, upbringing of my child and performing all the duties which a housewife like you and me does. As years passed I felt as if I was living a monotonous life. In serving the family need and desire I forgot my value , my needs and desire in life. This is what happens to many housewives.I felt to the prey of loneliness , had certain health issues, no charm in life and so on. One fine day my son asked me mamma why do you stay at home alone? What do you do at home after we leave the house? Why don’t you do some productive work like other working women or why don’t you join papa’s office?  I was just starring at him with no answers. That whole night I was unable to sleep I spend whole night thinking on it that my son was right, why should  I hold myself back with the old limiting belief. TODAY THE WORLD HAS CHANGED so as the belief. There are many successful women and their stories of achievement available to the world so why I can’t be one among them. After 20 years of just been a housewife I have now decided to start my career again and follow my passion of inspiring women like me to take steps to change their life and live the life as a queen.\r\nETR:- I don’t had any training background before so I acquired and learned the skills of training with a mentor who is a trainer. Under his guidance and mentorship I am now a certified trainer and I owe my gratitude to him that he has trained me to this level. I am also a certified NLP practitioner. With all my experience and knowledge available I have designed a system to help other homemakers to have their own identity. I know the program which I have designed will work for you also because I know the pain and problem of a housewife as I have experienced it and I also know the solution which worked for me will also work for you.

Both were dressed up in a gorgeous attire,wearing make up and precious jewellery. It was difficult to judge whose appearance was best among the two.But still Maya was looking be more attractive and gorgeous then Meena. It was because Maya was satisfied and happy from inside. She had self love for her. She had set her own priority and values for herself, whereas on the other hand for Meena others were more important and valuable then herself. She had buried her desire, her choices,her love for herself and was unhappy and unsatisfied from inside. The inner beauty of both reflected on their outer appearance which made Maya Look more attractive then Meena. It is like cleaning a photoframe. The photoframe no matter how u keep it clean from outside it will not appear sparkling clean unless you clear it from inside also. So it is important to be happy from inside also. If you won’t value yourself you can’t be happy or satisfied. In order to serve others and make others happy one has to fill your inner tank with it. Aperson whose inner tank is empty cannot fill others tank with satisfaction and happiness. A women who don’t value herself can’t add value to her family and her childrens life.\r\n2. Story of Nisha\r\nNisha was a housewife. She was fond of cooking and serving her family with different varieties of delicious food each time. She used to spend majority of her time in kitchen. On the dinning table everyone used to eat silently and enjoy the food. Nisha starred at each member with a question on how was the food? In reply she used to receive a smile from them. Nisha was not satisfied with the only smile,she expected words of appreciation from her family. She was feeling neglected for not been appreciated. She felt that to satisfy her family she used to prepare food of their choices, not caring about her choice ,sacrificed her rest time, not visiting her parent or friends oftenly, neglected her health issues etc.etc.but no one bother about her. This was what she shared when she met me. I told her that the problem was not with them the problem is in you. Have you ever pampered yourself, if no then how can you expect others to pamper you. Making food of their choice and neglecting your choice was only your decision. Have they ever told you not to make food of your choice also someday. Have you ever declared your choice or your priority to them . The answer to all the above question was NO..Many of us face the problem like Nisha. The greatest urge in human nature is to feel important. Research shows shows time to time again how people who work full time nag less than those who spend long periods isolated from others in the home. They see their contribution to the big scheme to things as important and feel their efforts is recognized by others but fail to recognize themselves.\r\n3.

All my parents saving and finance were spend on our education and marriages. In the year 2005 my father was diagnosed with blockage in heart and also to replace his heart valve which had a hole in it. So he has to undergo for an open heart surgery which was costing in lakhs. To meet the expenses we sisters started tours and travels business. We don’t wanted to take any financial help from our in-laws so took this step. The surgery was done and he was cured .A year after that my Mom was detected with breast cancer. On the arrival of reports her cancer was on the third stage. So she needs to be operated and after that have to undergo painful chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Finance was also an issue to meet the expense but somehow we managed it, but the main issue which areised was who will look after them when both of the are in pain. As per the belief that parents can’t stay at their daughters place after their marriage, the society won’t allow them ,so they were not ready to stay at our place initially,but after deep dissussion they agreed on it. My parents used to stay at my and my sister place. It took her a year to complete her treatment for cancer. She was recovering from cancer. We thought now it was the end to my parents sufferings but no life have stored something else for them. My father who has completely recovered from his open heart surgery was again diagnosed  with gagerine He was diabetic patient so his foot was amputed from the knee to save his life. Now he was left with only one foot to walk. It again took him more then a year to accept the fact that he have to learn to walk with his one leg. He learned to survive and walk with artificial leg he was happy. After few months his genital parts was infected because of gagerine. Again he was operated .But this time he lost his willpower and could not survive against the multiple pain. He died in the year 2010. It is said that women are weak so they are not allowed to enter cremation ground. But going against the society and the belief that a boy only have the rights to the funeral ceremony, we three sisters did everything as per hindu dharma a boy was supposed to do. In this decision our husband and my mom and few family members supported us. After six month my mom was again diagnosed with cancer this time cancer was spreading in her whole body again she has to undergo the painful cemotherapy and radiation. She also died in the year 2011. From the year 2005 to 20011 we sisters took care of our parents both physically and financially with the support of our husbands. we fought against all those beliefs and the odds. We have set the trend that women can perform all the rituals and proved that she is as strong as a men. Now, in our community women are allowed to enter cremation ground. The point of sharing this story with you was that women have the power in her to fight against all odds and be as strong as men.\r\n', 0),

Whenever I saw something I used to feel responsible that I should do something about it.\r\n\r\nI was born in a small village. My father was a farmer and my grandfather were also a farmer. As a child I was a very shy I would hide if someone ask me anything.\r\nWent to school people laughed at me because I was a slow learner, I used to afraid of teachers. My cousins always made me realize that they are smarter than me. I always saw myself as dreamer and use to think that one day I will do something important but had no idea what. I use to get scared of maths. I was an average student throughout academics.\r\nI remember once I said to my father that I want to become an entrepreneur. He laughed at me and said Jayda bade sapne mat dekh. Tere tau ne business karke chod diya hai. I believed him.\r\n\r\nAfter schooling I had no clue what to do. family decided that I should become an engineer. I did. I failed in engineering once. But somehow passed it. \r\n\r\nmy real struggle started after college. I could not find a job and I along with my friend started a web development company and it was shut down within 4 months. Again, started searching for the job. I was jobless for 2 years. After attempting more than 150 interviews finally I got a job in a small company.\r\n\r\nNever felt that I belong to the corporate world. I saw politics and manipulation. People will say something on your face and will say something at your back. I thought of quitting many a times but had no option or believed that I’m not good enough. After few years I felt stuck in my job.\r\n\r\nPeople use to push me around. Thinking he is useless.\r\nThere was a time when I said enough is enough. I was so angry with myself I didn’t know what to do with my life what would be my future. I decided that no matter what from now onwards I will take 100 percent responsibility of my life. I will not allow anyone to manipulate me.\r\n\r\nI started studying books and started understanding how mind works, how to achieve growth in life. I mastered these tools and strategies. My real life changed after I found a document which explained a technique how to focus your mind. I later put it into my System which we will be discussing it later.\r\n\r\nAfter few months People noticed that this guy has transformed, Immediately I was promoted as a Project Manager.  \r\n\r\nAfter a year or so I realised that life is going very fast I’m already 40 years old. I remembered my childhood dream and felt if I don’t do anything I will die without achieving it.

She lost her head and said that Kevin (my friend and our neighbour) will now get the first rank and not me. She lost her head and started beating me. She first began with her hands and then realised that it wasn’t enough. She got the shoes and beat me up with it. She then called Mrs. Kotwal and made me confess that I hid the marks from her and I had to apologise. The phone apparently wasn’t replaced back on the wall mount and Mrs. Kotwal could hear my mom shouting at me. My mum then got the belt and started beating me with the buckle. I was yelling and pleading with my mum to stop, but she kept going.\r\nThe next day when I reached Mrs. Kotwal’s home for tuition, she stood horrified at the door. Tears swelled in her eyes and she asked me what happened to my hands. I said that I fell down. I entered her house and sat at the table for my math class. Mrs. Kotwal just walked over slowly and stared at me. When I looked up at her, she held my palm and said “Sorry”. I was confused and asked her why she said sorry as she did nothing wrong. Mrs. Kotwal then confessed that she heard the walloping that I got and she was sorry that she didn’t leave her home to come to mine to save me.\r\nSo, I was beaten till I was 20 years old. I never had the strength or courage to fight back. I kept everything in me – not sharing anything, believing that I was useless (as that’s what I was always told). When I finally realised that enough was enough, I ran away from home. Today, I am who I am because I decided that my life had to change.\r\nFew years later, I went back home after a lengthy discussion with my father. Today, I have a lovely relationship with my mother. I have forgiven her for she did. I have gotten over my pain. I still remember it. It still hurts when I recount those incidents. But, the pain doesn’t cripple or stop me. I was able to do this only because of my system. My system made me make a decision, a decision to get away from the pain. A decision to stand up and not get any more abuse. My system made me get stronger and then face my tormentor/abuser; and finally, overcome my pain through forgiveness.\r\n', 0),

(516, 264733, 5, 2, '•	Identify the presence of pain\r\nMrs. Shah (name changed) was a very difficult person to deal with. Neighbours and relative didn’t like interacting with her as she would lash out at them. One day, during a heart-to-heart conversation, she happened to mention that she didn’t want to marry her husband. She was from Bombay and her husband was from a small city. He wore glasses and she didn’t fancy him. But she was coaxed into marrying him. She saw this as the end of her life as an educated woman from a metro city. This ate at her. She started being disappointed at everything. She began to harbour hatred to everything about her marriage.\r\n•	Awareness of the pain\r\nMelwin was a hotel professional that I came across during one of my postings. He was kind and funny. Everyone liked him. One time, he decided to throw a Christmas party for his friends. He make a list of dishes that he would cook and for each family, he planned a small Christmas basket. He placed the order for cookies, cakes, chocolates, gingerbread house and other Christmas delicacies and asked for it to be packed in separate Christmas boxes. He was very excited. However, on the day of the party, the 5-star hotel where he placed the order, messed up the order and it wasn’t ready. He was getting late as his friends would be arriving at home and he was required to be there to welcome them. He lost his head. He looked at this as a major goof-up by a big hotel brand. He was so upset that people walked out of the pastry shop. His order was delivered late to his residence, but his family friends enjoyed every bit of the party. The next day, the General Manager of the hotel called Melwin and said that he got a complaint from the competing hotel that Melwin had lost his head.\r\nNow this is where it gets interesting, it seems that Melwin was always let down by his parents. In his head, he never got the love that he wanted. He had a high standard of what a relationship meant. And that’s why, when the hotel fell back on its commitment, he saw this as a break in that relationship and it pained him.\r\nOften, our behaviour is shown in a different manner. When Melwin came to peace with his parents’ behaviour, he calmed down as a person. He stopped lashing out.\r\n•	Acknowledge the presence of pain. Have acceptance\r\nNow this is a story of an instance where the client didn’t want to accept that there is any pain.\r\nRose (name changed) was a 33 year old girl who was still single. She was taunted by her family to get married. Finally, she got married to a boy who she believed had all the characteristics that she was looking for. She had 3 elder brothers – who were married. She once laughed and told her sisters-in-law that their husbands (Rose’s brothers) were no match for the knowledge, success and class that her husband had. However, when the marriage took place, it was a bumpy ride. Within 3 months, they went seeking for help. She apparently said that her friends said that the first year of marriage is rocky and therefore, she didn’t want to do ANYTHING in the first year to make it worse. She was hoping for the second year to come and for things to automatically be better. Rose wasn’t even willing to kiss her husband. This couple went from counsellor to counsellor seeking help. It was finally realised that Rose was molested when she was a young child. She was made to crush this thought and sweep it under the carpet. Hence, her behaviour of stepping aside whenever there was a problem. She thought that she had hidden her pain. But it was affecting her marriage. Her mother was instrumental in squashing the molestation issue as she believed “who else will give me money” and “why should we cause any more pain”. Rose believed that there was nothing wrong as her mother used to tell her that. Ultimately, the couple had to divorce. All because Rose didn’t accept the presence of pain and work on it.\r\n•	Realise the pain\r\nRemember the Mrs. Shah example that I told you….it was only when she viewed the 3 points together, did she realise how she was behaving. She then took a decision to change for the better.\r\n•	Get to the source\r\nSo, Melwin decided to address his issue of his relationship with his parents. This made him a more loveable person professionally. While earlier he was known to be a perfectionist, he now would explain reasons to his colleague.\r\nRose decided to not get to the source. Today, she is still unhappy. She lives in her own fantasy world where she hardly has any friends.\r\n', 0),

FANTASTIC!!\r\n\r\nETR\r\nI will break this up and give snippets throughout the day otherwise people get bored. \r\nI would like to start the sharing process off by sharing my story. And then I would love to hear your story and why you are here today.  \r\nI was a born speaker, but not a born public speaker- that was a skill I acquired over the years. I am from England and was born and brought up there. I lived in a huge joint family for the first 16 years of my life so had to learn how to get on with everyone – a really crucial skill! I also had to learn to be diplomatic but get what I needed in the process. In fact, growing up in a joint family can teach you a lot of life skills like negotiating, the art of diplomacy, how to get your point across. But one can also get lost in the crowd – be almost invisible. \r\nSo I learnt pretty quickly in life  that we all react differently to our environments. While I became a happy go lucky child and a brat as my brother and sisters constantly tell me, my sister became an introvert – she got lost in the crowd. I thrive when I am in the company of lots of people and there is general chaos but my sister feels lost and on edge. She loves smaller groups and focussed and serious conversation. And she is like that today too. Sometimes this works for her and sometimes it works against her. She finds it difficult making conversation with strangers and when she moved to America she would feel extremely lonely. Unfortunately, it took her ages to actually break this pattern, she just didn’t see it as a priority or the consequences it was having on her life. Had she done a simple exercise I will do with you all alter – she would have definitely taken action earlier and I think her life would be very different today.  (seeding to take action NOW and consequences of not taking action). May mention her suicide attempts. Not sure. \r\nI was fine in a crowd but I was not fine standing up in class or stage and talking in front of a crowd. I would get this horrible sick feeling in my stomach and could only hear my loud breathing. And when I finally spoke, I had no idea what I would say. I got away with this in school but when I went to boarding school and wanted to stand for council, my teachers didn’t choose me because they had never heard me speak in a crowd. At the time I didn’t realise this – I was only told this years later when I visited my school and bumped into a few of my teachers. Not being chosen for prefect really shattered my confidence and affected other aspects of my life. My 2 years in boarding school were miserable as I was thrown into a very English environment and didn’t know how to build rapport with most people. For years I thought I wasn’t good enough and so stop trying and became a recluse. I took a gap year after college and worked for 6 months – that forced me to interact with all sorts of people So, when it came to university I didn’t even try standing for anything as I thought I wasn’t good enough and would never get it. How I wish I had not allowed a simple thing like learning to stand in public and speak  hold me back in life. If only I had spoken to my teachers earlier I would have definitely joined a course. \r\nIt struck around 10 years later that I had to get over this lack of confidence and fight my fears head on. I had been a copywriter for years and had been asked to train corporates on language skills and email etiquette. I said NO. I didn’t even consider it. \r\nI felt very frustrated being a copywriter and really bored. Decided to say yes when the next person asked and basically went in blind. But learnt a lot and read up and was basically self-taught.  Joined another course last year and that helped me be comfortable speaking in front of hundreds and being natural.  I am really bored now. Will finish this later – talk about how I didn’t fit in when I came to india.\r\nI will talk about not fitting in in India and trying to fit in my being who I wasn’t and how that got me frustrated. So I still didn’t fit in in spite of being who I thought I needed to be to fit in. Eventually I realised I had to be true to who I was and that’s when my life started changing and I made really good friends who loved me for who I am. I started not caring what people thought of me – and that is big part of my system – attaining the “I don’t care what you think of me’ attitude. \r\nI have worked with thousands of people and the biggest issue they face or what is holding them back is their lack of confidence and self worth. Another key part of my system is attitude – having the right mindset to becoming a great communicator. I also make people realise how being a great communicator can really impact your life  in a big way and completely transform it. \r\n\r\n10.15am – 10.45am\r\nIntroducing part one of my system – Awareness\r\nWhat is holding your back from success?\r\nI would like to know a little about you and why you are here. It’s really important to know your audience if you want to build rapport and for that you have to listen! Who would like to share? The first step of my Extreme Impact system is Awareness, knowing your truth.  I really encourage you all to share as only then can I work with you during the day. Also, when you share your story you inspire others to share theirs and the issues you may be facing are most likely faced by many others here today. \r\nWill ask 4 members of the audience to share why they are here. \r\nBy getting people to share why they are here, I get a sense of the issues they are facing but they are most likely those listed below. I will write down their issues. \r\n\r\nPossibilities\r\n•	Difficulty expressing themselves\r\n•	Low self confidence\r\n•	Don’t think they are good enough\r\n•	Inferiority complex\r\n•	Lonely\r\n•	Misunderstood\r\n•	Bitter/resentful/jealous of others who communicate well\r\n•	Not advancing in their career\r\n•	Money issues due to poor communication \r\n•	Don’t really leave an impression / invisible\r\n•	People take them for granted\r\n•	Don’t know how to say no\r\n•	I don’t know who I am \r\n•	I am living a lie and not being myself\r\n\r\nThank you so much for sharing – please clap for them. \r\nI am going to give you some alarming statistics - \r\nTechnical skills contribute to only 25% of your performance. The remaining 75% comes from communication and personal skills, including: Decision making, assertiveness, authenticity, commitment to grow, enthusiasm, judgment, energy level, resourcefulness, honesty, integrity, optimism, persistence, initiative and knowing how to connect with people quickly and easily.\r\nCommunication skills are a critical component of success. You will not be successful if you have poor communication skills be it at professionally or personally. In fact you will be downright miserable. That’s a fact.  If your communication skills are not up to the mark you do not stand a chance at true happiness. The irony is that if we have poor communication skills we don’t know our true potential. I have worked with thousands of people who didn’t even realise what they were capable of and they didn’t realise it was their communication skills or lack of skills that was one of the main reasons holding them back.  That’s the power of a coach. ESTABLISHING THE NEED FOR A COACH\r\nSeeding using an analogy  - need for a coach\r\nIt’s like a runner who wants to run a marathon. If he puts in a little effort he will finish it in under 5 hours. And he will see that as a great timing. But his coach will recognize his potential because that is what coaches are great at and will push him to reach his potential.  How many of you have been told by a teacher at school that if you put in a little effort you could be outstanding at a subject?  For how many of you did that come as a shock? And how did it make you feel? Did you work harder because someone believed in you?\r\nSeeding \r\nLet me illustrate my point. I worked with someone called Uma. Uma is one of my favourite clients. When I first started coaching her, she was low in self-confidence and very serious in spite of being an HOD and highly respected and liked in the company. I knew there was more to her and that she was someone who did not realise how amazing she was. I think most of us don’t realise how amazing we are. We tend to focus on our weaknesses rather than our strengths. What was holding Uma back? Her lack of confidence in herself. I worked with her using my extreme impact system  by identifying her strengths and leveraging them. Identifying her strengths (most of which she was not even aware of) boosted her confidence and this made her lower her guard. Within 3 months (establishing 3 months – length of program) there was quite a change in her. She started smiling and laughing and her confidence sky rocketed. In fact, he bosses noticed the change and sent her abroad for a conference. \r\nI will refer to Uma quite a bit today as she is the classic case of an uncut diamond. She didn’t know her worth until I made her discover her strengths and qualities. And that is true of most of the people I work with – they don’t know their strengths and amazing qualities. They only know and focus on their weaknesses and that’s where they get stuck – like a song that is just replaying over and over again. Many times we only break out of that pattern when someone gives us a good shake down.  \r\nHow many of you tend to focus on your weaknesses or go into victim mode – why why why? \r\nUntil you get out this pattern you will never be a good communicator and you will never be as successful as you can be. You will never reach your potential or beyond. You need to turn the why into how – why doesn’t anyone listen to me. How can I get people to listen to me. \r\nIdentifying your strengths is a large part of being a good communicator and once you know that you will be well on the way to being a kick ass communicator. How to leverage them is the next and crucial step. That is what will make your delivery original, authentic and effortless. \r\nHow many of you really want to communicate well and get out of this rut you are in? Please be truthful not to me but to you. Think hard about this. This process that I am about to do with you is something I do with my clients but you have to be truthful if you want to know the truth!!\r\n\r\n\r\n10.45am – 11.30am\r\n\r\nActivity One \r\nData Point - awareness\r\n\r\nI want you to write down\r\n\r\nA)	Name one area of your life where you feel communication is holding you back. Let’s just focus on one area right not. Write it down.\r\n\r\nPossibilities\r\n•	Career\r\n•	Relationships – personal and professional\r\n•	Money – asking for it\r\n\r\nB)	Now in detail write down what precisely is not working in that area. For example if it is your career it could be that you are not getting a promotion or recognition from your boss. If it’s a relationship it could be friction with you’re a co-worker or being unable to motivate your team. It could also be personal – not getting on with your spouse or children or parents or a friend. If it’s money it could be not being able to ask for money or how does one ask for it without sounding greedy or desperate? This is a very common issue. \r\nC)	How is this issue or your communication or lack of it, that is  jeopardizing your life or career make you feel? I want you to use adjectives, describing words – angry, resentful, frustrated, sad. I want you to write down how it affects you emotionally. Be honest with yourself – that is the first step in my system – your truth – awareness. You do not have to share this if you don’t want to. \r\nD)	Most people don’t realise that communication affects all aspects of your life. If you are having issues at work, then you are most likely having issues at home too. Write these down – how it is seeping into other parts of your life. \r\n\r\nIntensifying pain by showing them that communication affects more than they imagined. Now look at consequences of not taking action. Consequences of taking action. \r\n\r\nE)	Imagine if you don’t take action what your life will be like in 2 years time – consequences of taking action. Write this down\r\nF)	Imagine you take action now – how will your life change. Write this down. \r\n\r\nSeeding (how lack of communication skills can wreak havoc in your life and the need to address your poor communication skills) intensifying pain. Investing in yourself and making a decision/following your instinct. YOU ARE WORTH IT \r\n\r\nKavita – Story – how her frustration at work seeped into her home life and her frustrations with her husband’s sister. It got worse because she refused to deal with the issue at work – her boss had changed her work profile without any valid reason. When she asked him he said it was so she could spend more time with her young daughter but Kavita was not convinced.  So, her stress and resentment came out on her sister in law and she could only focus on her sis in laws negative points and not her positives. We tend to do that when we are unhappy.  She also didn’t know how to talk to her sister and boss in law without them taking offence. Her BP went up, she started arguing with her husband, she feel frustrated at work and truly unhappy. And she felt alone. No one understood what she was going through. In fact people kept telling her about the good things going on in her life and that she should focus on those things. The told her she was lucky to have a job in such a good company and  lucky she had such a supportive husband. \r\nHow many of you focus on the good things in your life if you cant deal with the bad things or things that are making  you unhappy?  Kavita tried to convince herself that she should focus on the good aspects of her life  for 2 years. 2 years she  was miserable. Because there is no point treating a headache if you have a stomach ache.  Some things you can’t change in life but some things you can. Communication is one of them. \r\nBy the time Kavita came to me she was low on confidence – she had always been very confident but her change in profile really shattered her confidence and she no longer got attention from her boss. In fact he was very offish with her. I asked her why it took so long for her to come to seek help. (THE NEED TO MAKE CHANGE NOW). She told me that she had thought about coming to me a year ago but her family dissuaded her – why do you want to spend on something like this, it will sort itself out, leave it to fate. Then they started blaming her for being so snappy and always in a bad mood. \r\n\r\nSeeding strategy session plus dealing with objections to joining the program – I don’t need it, I don’t have the money, I can manage myself.\r\nEventually Kavita decided to follow her instinct and came to me. She tried to deal with it herself but couldn’t. It’s like being unwell and self-medicating. It can do you more harm. Does it not make sense to see an expert? Someone who is trained in this and know what is best for you? Yes, short term you will pay but see the benefits and long term you will gain.  She realised that if she   continued like this she would eventually get fired and divorced.   \r\n\r\nWe met and I used a tool I have to discover exactly what her issues were. She frankly spoke about her issues, frustration etc. We decided a call to action at the end of the session – she would talk to her boss. She described her boss to me which was crucial so that together we could figure out how to talk to him so she would get the outcome she wanted.  It was a fantastic strategy meeting and she had amazing breakthroughs/realisations.  I have been coaching her for around 8 months now and she told me that since that initial meeting, her life had changed for the better. In fact, she got a promotion a month after talking to her boss, who was actually on the verge of firing her!  Her relationship with her sister in law is much better. And this is all because of her communication skills and attitude. She also told me something very interesting. She told me that she never felt worthy of investing in herself. She wouldn’t think twice about investing in her daughter’s education.  That was also one of the reasons she never came to me earlier. I charge 3 lakhs for personal coaching a year and around Rs 20,000 for a strategy session. She felt had she come earlier, things would not have gotten so bad.  She had almost gone into a deep depression. \r\n\r\nKavita took control of her life -  only we know what is best for us, not our friends or family. But sometimes you need a coach to get you out of the rut of life and show you the way. Because that is their area of expertise - they have the tools and strategies. And they will always have your best interest at heart. \r\n\r\nBecause you guys have been such a great audience I am going to give you a complimentary strategy session of around 10/15 minutes. You can register at the back. This session will give you clarity in your life but I won’t be offering it to everyone. Only those who fit certain criteria – primarily those committed to making change RIGHT NOW in their life.\r\n\r\nVVIP (lunch and front seat and a free dvd) (VIP is coffee with me, front seat)\r\nYou also have a chance to have a 45 minute lunch with me where I will share some amazing strategies with you that I have devised over the last 15 years. There are only xx seats available (have max 15 VIP seats – would have sold some before/at the start / of the seminar) \r\n\r\nLet’s break for tea and once we are back I would love to hear what area in your life communication if affecting. During the break I want you to share this with at least 2 people. Introduce yourselves and build a rapport. Talk to someone who you have not spoken to  yet. \r\n\r\nYou can run from your problems but you can’t hide. The will catch up with you and bite you hard. You have to face them head on and with a kick ass attitude, otherwise you will lead a life of unhappiness. \r\n11.30 – 12pm TEA BREAK\r\n12pm – 12.30pm \r\nWelcome back!!  How was your tea break?  Did you all talk to at least 2 people and share what you had written down? Do you feel lighter now that you have shared? Who would like to share? A problem shared is a problem halved. \r\nGet 2 people to share and intensify their pain.  \r\nSo now you are all pretty clear/AWARE of how poor communication skills are affecting your lives. Now what? Who wants to take ACTION RIGHT NOW?? \r\nGreat – for those who have not raised your hands could you share when you would like to take action or if indeed plan to? Some of us like to suffer and play the victim. You surround yourselves with similar people – the victim circle. That is what gives you power and is in you comfort level. But it never ends happily. You have to surround yourself with the tight people. That’s what I love about my group coaching/program – everyone is on the same journey of growth and change and everyone understands you and supports you. And I get the privilege of working with some amazing people – all winners to me because they have taken the first step to success because they value themselves and they see the big picture, (seeded that my program is for winners and the value of circle of excellence) and they are committed to change. \r\nSEED A STORY HERE about being in victim mode - from a movie they can all relate to. \r\n12.30pm to 1.15pm\r\nActivity TWO \r\nData point ATTITUDE - do you have the mindset of a winner? Those who have joined my program do. (making my program elite and exclusive – losers not allowed on the program) Knowing your Code and the code needed to be a winner\r\nI have a really difficult challenge for you all – it involves you coming on stage and I will ask you to do something – a dare. Anything and you have to do it. There is a chance of you winning something.  But if you come on stage and don’t do the dare I ask you to then you have to give me Rs 500. How many of you are game? How many are not? Hmmm interesting. \r\n\r\nTell me what is going on in your mind right now – \r\n(These will fit into the following 4 categories which I will write down). \r\n\r\n1.	NO WAY - what will people think? What if I fail? If I don’t try then I cant fail!!\r\n2.	Hmmm – should I or should I not – sitting on the fence -weighing the pros and cons. Most people on the fence stay there - you think and think and do nothing. You will have the same problems. Unless all the facts are presented in front of them they won’t make a decision. they err on the side of caution. \r\n3.	Those who said yes immediately can be split into 2 categories\r\na)	They are geared up and mentally preparing for the challenge and they want to win! They are curious about the challenge. \r\nb)	They have said yes and will go with the flow. We will see. Pretty relaxed. If I win great if I lose no problem. \r\nc)	Oh shit what have I said – oh no oh no oh no. Was I mad saying yes? REGRET \r\n\r\nWe tend to say yes to things in our comfort zone but the test is whether we are up for challenges outside of our comfort zone. So for those who said yes – for how many is it in your comfort zone? And for those who said yes for how many is it out of your comfort zone? \r\n\r\nWhat kind of attitude gets you ahead in life? And why? \r\n\r\nShare\r\n \r\nYour mindset says a lot about your attitude in general. What does your mindset about this challenge say about you? Is that your attitude to your life in general? \r\n\r\nYour Attitude is holding you back in life\r\nThis is what is holding you back from success. You can’t buy attitude but luckily attitude is something that can be worked on and changed if the desire is there. Attitude is something I work on extensively using tools that I have devised over my 15 years as a Communications coach. I change attitudes so that my clients have the attitude of a winner.  You need the right attitude if you want to be successful. \r\n\r\nSeeding my system – step 2 of it – Attitude\r\nTalk about Sharad and how he pretended to be a rich man. He faked it but he had the attitude. People treated him differently and this really boosted his confidence. \r\n\r\nWe have had people completely change – transform – just by doing these crazy activities. From being shy and unsure of themselves and worried what people will think, they have gone on to be confident, resilient and not worried about what others will think. And they have become so comfortable in their skin. This has transferred into their attitude to life – both at home an work – they don’t sweat the small stuff any longer. They are able to express themselves more freely without worrying what people will think. Will talk about Sharad. Sharad was completely shy and lacked confidence. So I made him create an alter ego and pretend to be that alter ego. He had to go for a medical check up. So he dressed up like a confident and classy ich man and that was the part he played! He was treated differently  - with more respect and it really gave him a boost in confidence. In fact he said how he felt inside was what came across in his body language and tone. He said he would continue being this alter ego until it was his permanent attitude. \r\nIf you want to be a great communicate not just someone who impacts but someone who has extreme impact, then you need to have the right attitude! The mindset of a winner. \r\nSeed a story here about someone who changed their mindset and became successful. \r\nAfter lunch we are going to talk about building rapport and we are going have some crazy activities!! \r\nActivity THREE – during lunch\r\nData Point – fake the attitude till you become it (like sharad) \r\nBefore you go for lunch – I want you to go to lunch with the attitude of a winner. Fake it - pretend to be someone who is super confident – you can pick someone you admire or someone who is famous.  Be that person and interact with people accordingly. Move out of your comfort zone!\r\n1.15pm – 2.15 Lunch Break \r\n2.15pm – 2.30pm\r\nDid you all fake it? How did you feel? \r\nShare\r\nTalk about how you need to be genuine. I help clients discover their strengths like I mentioned earlier and discover how they can communicatee in a genuine and authentic way – only then will their delivery be effortless. \r\n2.30pm to 3.30m\r\nActivity FOUR– get them out of their lunch time slumber. \r\nData Point - Building resilience and the right attitude for extreme impact!\r\nData Point – how to Influence and the power of a group (something they will experience when they join my program)\r\nHow many of you are willing to come on stage for this activity? Hopefully more people will raise their hands? What has changed for those who said no earlier? SHARE\r\nSeeding a vision \r\nIt’s great that you guys want the attitude of a winner and realise how crucial it is. But do you think you will have it once you get home?  Or next week?  Most people slip back to their ways until they attend another seminar – then they get that invincible attitude for a while. But imagine having that 24x7 – how amazing would your life be. How many experiences and stories would you have? Imagine how powerful you would feel and that would come across in your attitude! Refer to your notes from the earlier activity. Imagine having someone there 24x7 to push you and stop you from reverting to slumber mode. Imagine having a group pushing you and being accountable to them. How amazing would that be?\r\nData Point – not making change permanent/ not investing time/need for a coach\r\nI have been a coach for an international German company for 3 years now. Initially I was hired to improve their English and make it international and as well work on their email writing. I worked with one of the HODs, Deepika. She attended my sessions for around 6 months but then felt she didn’t have time to continue. She felt she would manage herself. 4 months later she was back. Her boss was horrified at how she had gone back to her old ways. She felt too proud to come back as it was accepting defeat. But I welcomed her back and was glad she could continue on her journey. We need someone to push us otherwise we tend to slip back. \r\nI want everyone to experience this activity. How many of you have said no? Please come to the front. Don’t worry I will not make you do anything you don’t want to. Now I want those who have said yes to get into groups of 10. Let’s move the chairs to the side. \r\n(Activity Four) (high energy music)\r\nI will send the “Nos” to the yes group and they have 4 minutes to convert them – and how will I know you have succeeded? The Nos will be willing to go on stage for the challenge. \r\nI want to know which of the Nos are now willing to go on stage? How did you convert them? so this is called influencing. Are you a successful influencer? What strategies did you use? Write on board. \r\nSeed here  - use the example of Sunil  - hard working, knowledgeable and professional \r\nActivity FIVE\r\nWhat is your mindset right now? Slumber or winner mindset? Get into Winner mode!!\r\nNow in your groups of 10 – I will be giving you a short paragraph and you have to choose one person who will read the paragraph and the rest of the group have to act it out. Each group will be given different sentences and they have to come on stage and perform.  The best performance will get be the winner!!\r\nSentences will be mad –‘ I went in the jungle and saw a group of african dancers doing a wild tribal dance’. \r\nPost mortem \r\nHow do you all feel? Would you have thought of doing this before you came before? If I can spend just 3 months with you, you will see magic!! \r\nAudience share – how they felt – how they have changed today. \r\nI need to fit this data point in at the beginning somewhere. \r\nData Point - Building rapport –  powerful introductions. \r\nEveryone introduce yourself in 20 seconds to 2 different people. I want a volunteer to come on stage and introduce themselves – everyone should volunteer – get out of that slumber zone!! Put on that winning attitude! \r\nWork with them and give tips – physiology, tone, words are so important and your attitude – do you value who you are?? Fake it – imagine being someone confident. Now think of the words you use – something that is amazing. Use that in your introduction so that people remember you in 10 years’ time!\r\nNow you have to do it again. Spend 2 minutes thinking of a great introduction and use it. \r\nHow was it this time? Of course this is just one type of introduction   - I spend a good hour on this – different environments/audience require different introductions. They can make you or break you\r\n3.30pm – 4.15pm OFFER \r\nHow many of you think you can now be great communicators? how many of you feel you can achieve your dreams? How many of you want to take action NOW? I want you to go back to your notes from the first activity we did. How your life will be if you don’t make change and how it will be if you do – which one do you want? You have a choice! Now or never – Winner mode or slumber mode? \r\nI would now love to share my 3 month program if I may\r\nI am sooo excited about my kick ass program.\r\nWhat is the aim of my program? It is for you to be able to talk to anyone, anywhere with impact and influence in an authentic, natural and original style. This establishes trust and influences your audience into action. I am sure when the “Nos’ were influenced by the “yeses’ then the ones who said yes did so because trust was established. \r\nOutcomes – will summarise this into 8/9 points on ppt\r\nBy the end of this 3 month program:-\r\n1.

(523, 221501, 3, 2, 'I will break this up and give snippets throughout the day otherwise people get bored. \r\nI would like to start the sharing process off by sharing my story. And then I would love to hear your story and why you are here today.  \r\nI was a born speaker, but not a born public speaker- that was a skill I acquired over the years. I am from England and was born and brought up there. I lived in a huge joint family for the first 16 years of my life so had to learn how to get on with everyone – a really crucial skill! I also had to learn to be diplomatic but get what I needed in the process. In fact, growing up in a joint family can teach you a lot of life skills like negotiating, the art of diplomacy, how to get your point across. But one can also get lost in the crowd – be almost invisible. \r\nSo I learnt pretty quickly in life  that we all react differently to our environments. While I became a happy go lucky child and a brat as my brother and sisters constantly tell me, my sister became an introvert – she got lost in the crowd. I thrive when I am in the company of lots of people and there is general chaos but my sister feels lost and on edge. She loves smaller groups and focussed and serious conversation. And she is like that today too. Sometimes this works for her and sometimes it works against her. She finds it difficult making conversation with strangers and when she moved to America she would feel extremely lonely. Unfortunately, it took her ages to actually break this pattern, she just didn’t see it as a priority or the consequences it was having on her life. Had she done a simple exercise I will do with you all alter – she would have definitely taken action earlier and I think her life would be very different today.  (seeding to take action NOW and consequences of not taking action). May mention her suicide attempts. Not sure. \r\nI was fine in a crowd but I was not fine standing up in class or stage and talking in front of a crowd. I would get this horrible sick feeling in my stomach and could only hear my loud breathing. And when I finally spoke, I had no idea what I would say. I got away with this in school but when I went to boarding school and wanted to stand for council, my teachers didn’t choose me because they had never heard me speak in a crowd. At the time I didn’t realise this – I was only told this years later when I visited my school and bumped into a few of my teachers. Not being chosen for prefect really shattered my confidence and affected other aspects of my life. My 2 years in boarding school were miserable as I was thrown into a very English environment and didn’t know how to build rapport with most people. For years I thought I wasn’t good enough and so stop trying and became a recluse. I took a gap year after college and worked for 6 months – that forced me to interact with all sorts of people So, when it came to university I didn’t even try standing for anything as I thought I wasn’t good enough and would never get it. How I wish I had not allowed a simple thing like learning to stand in public and speak  hold me back in life. If only I had spoken to my teachers earlier I would have definitely joined a course. \r\nIt struck around 10 years later that I had to get over this lack of confidence and fight my fears head on. I had been a copywriter for years and had been asked to train corporates on language skills and email etiquette. I said NO. I didn’t even consider it. \r\nI felt very frustrated being a copywriter and really bored. Decided to say yes when the next person asked and basically went in blind. But learnt a lot and read up and was basically self-taught.  Joined another course last year and that helped me be comfortable speaking in front of hundreds and being natural.  I am really bored now. Will finish this later – talk about how I didn’t fit in when I came to india.\r\nI will talk about not fitting in in India and trying to fit in my being who I wasn’t and how that got me frustrated. So I still didn’t fit in in spite of being who I thought I needed to be to fit in. Eventually I realised I had to be true to who I was and that’s when my life started changing and I made really good friends who loved me for who I am. I started not caring what people thought of me – and that is big part of my system – attaining the “I don’t care what you think of me’ attitude. \r\nI have worked with thousands of people and the biggest issue they face or what is holding them back is their lack of confidence and self worth. Another key part of my system is attitude – having the right mindset to becoming a great communicator. I also make people realise how being a great communicator can really impact your life  in a big way and completely transform it. \r\n\r\n', 0),

I also make people realise how being a great communicator can really impact your life  in a big way and completely transform it. \r\n\r\nNeed for a coach/Awareness Kavita\r\nKavita – Story – how her frustration at work seeped into her home life and her frustrations with her husband’s sister. It got worse because she refused to deal with the issue at work – her boss had changed her work profile without any valid reason. When she asked him he said it was so she could spend more time with her young daughter but Kavita was not convinced.  So, her stress and resentment came out on her sister in law and she could only focus on her sis in laws negative points and not her positives. We tend to do that when we are unhappy.  She also didn’t know how to talk to her sister and boss in law without them taking offence. Her BP went up, she started arguing with her husband, she feel frustrated at work and truly unhappy. And she felt alone. No one understood what she was going through. In fact people kept telling her about the good things going on in her life and that she should focus on those things. The told her she was lucky to have a job in such a good company and  lucky she had such a supportive husband. \r\nHow many of you focus on the good things in your life if you cant deal with the bad things or things that are making  you unhappy?  Kavita tried to convince herself that she should focus on the good aspects of her life  for 2 years. 2 years she  was miserable. Because there is no point treating a headache if you have a stomach ache.  Some things you can’t change in life but some things you can. Communication is one of them. \r\nBy the time Kavita came to me she was low on confidence – she had always been very confident but her change in profile really shattered her confidence and she no longer got attention from her boss. In fact he was very offish with her. I asked her why it took so long for her to come to seek help. (THE NEED TO MAKE CHANGE NOW). She told me that she had thought about coming to me a year ago but her family dissuaded her – why do you want to spend on something like this, it will sort itself out, leave it to fate. Then they started blaming her for being so snappy and always in a bad mood. \r\n\r\nSeeding strategy session plus dealing with objections to joining the program – I don’t need it, I don’t have the money, I can manage myself.\r\nEventually Kavita decided to follow her instinct and came to me. She tried to deal with it herself but couldn’t. It’s like being unwell and self-medicating. It can do you more harm. Does it not make sense to see an expert? Someone who is trained in this and know what is best for you? Yes, short term you will pay but see the benefits and long term you will gain.  She realised that if she   continued like this she would eventually get fired and divorced.   \r\n\r\nWe met and I used a tool I have to discover exactly what her issues were. She frankly spoke about her issues, frustration etc. We decided a call to action at the end of the session – she would talk to her boss. She described her boss to me which was crucial so that together we could figure out how to talk to him so she would get the outcome she wanted.  It was a fantastic strategy meeting and she had amazing breakthroughs/realisations.  I have been coaching her for around 8 months now and she told me that since that initial meeting, her life had changed for the better. In fact, she got a promotion a month after talking to her boss, who was actually on the verge of firing her!  Her relationship with her sister in law is much better. And this is all because of her communication skills and attitude. She also told me something very interesting. She told me that she never felt worthy of investing in herself. She wouldn’t think twice about investing in her daughter’s education.  That was also one of the reasons she never came to me earlier. I charge 3 lakhs for personal coaching a year and around Rs 20,000 for a strategy session. She felt had she come earlier, things would not have gotten so bad.  She had almost gone into a deep depression. \r\n\r\nKavita took control of her life -  only we know what is best for us, not our friends or family. But sometimes you need a coach to get you out of the rut of life and show you the way. Because that is their area of expertise - they have the tools and strategies. And they will always have your best interest at heart. \r\n\r\nReslience/attitude Sharad\r\nSharad was completely shy and lacked confidence. So I made him create an alter ego and pretend to be that alter ego. He had to go for a medical check up. So he dressed up like a confident and classy ich man and that was the part he played! He was treated differently  - with more respect and it really gave him a boost in confidence. In fact he said how he felt inside was what came across in his body language and tone. He said he would continue being this alter ego until it was his permanent attitude. \r\nIf you want to be a great communicate not just someone who impacts but someone who has extreme impact, then you need to have the right attitude! The mindset of a winner\r\n\r\nAttitude /Need for a coach/consistency Deepika\r\nI have been a coach for an international German company for 3 years now. Initially I was hired to improve their English and make it international and as well work on their email writing. I worked with one of the HODs, Deepika. She attended my sessions for around 6 months but then felt she didn’t have time to continue. She felt she would manage herself. 4 months later she was back. Her boss was horrified at how she had gone back to her old ways. She felt too proud to come back as it was accepting defeat. But I welcomed her back and was glad she could continue on her journey. We need someone to push us otherwise we tend to slip back. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 0),

Without the fear of making mistakes,without the fear of being judged as this is the only way to live a life full of passion, joy and exhilaration. Normally( or abnormally) we live such a constrained life because of such fears that we feel totally suffocated ,every day in our life just becomes another day and meaning of life is completely lost.\r\nThis was my story since I was a kid. I was a sharp and zealous child , but I always used to live in a fear of what others will think. I was always scared of committing mistakes as I never wanted to look bad and thus in lieu never used to take any action.\r\nI used to flunk in my subjects throughout my academics. I will study whole year but when the time of exams will come I used to develop cold feet and I would start doing some sort of self sabotaging action as my inner dialogue was- I am not good enough and I don’t deserve success & this is how I came to know about power of subconscious programming. \r\nAs there is a whole science behind human performance and why we do not perform at our best because of of parental, societal and environmental conditioning. Their language becomes our inner dialogue and it stops us at every place to be our best.\r\nAll this inner conflict also led to worsening of my health.\r\nI ballooned to 125 kgs as food became my source of comfort.\r\nAll this inner conflict,bad health and bad performance in my academics led to a major breakdown.\r\nI hit the rockbottom which led me to find a solution to this whole gamut of problem.\r\nI read a lot of self help books, been through numerous boot camps and things improved.\r\nI totally cut off from my social life and went deep into self discovery .\r\nIt took me a long time to come up with an efficient code for living \r\n& then I met my life coach and I realized the power of a mentor.\r\nIn Matrix they say that “ knowing the path and walking the path are two different things”\r\nYou may know the whole solution to the problem and if you don’t implement it then the problem will remain unsolved and you will stay in the rut.\r\nToday, when our life is so busy that we are totally lost, we feel there is no passion in our life,there is no aim, our health is not good ,our relationship sucks and and financially we are neck deep into debt, and the most important thing being we think these are all different problems.\r\nBut we need to realize that these are just by products of one major issue.\r\nWhen we work on that issue – every thing else start falling in line.\r\n& this is what a coach does for you.\r\nIts like having a vantage point.\r\nHe can see all our complexities that we are not able to see and guides and supports us to solve those problems.\r\nWhen I had a breakdown:\r\nMy inner peace was not there,\r\nI was totally lost\r\nMy health was worse\r\nI was stuck in a job I never liked\r\nI was scared of taking risks.\r\nMy relationships were not good as I was not being true to myself & If you are not being true to yourself then you cant be true to others and your relationships will suck.\r\nToday :\r\nI am healthy and fit as I have lost almost 45 kilos.\r\nI have quit my job and I am doing the work that I love to do.\r\nI love taking calculated risks.\r\nI am true to myself and have started having genuine communication with others and so my relationships have improved.\r\nAnd most importantly I am at peace with myslf as I have relized that there is only one life to live and it should be lived on your own terms and there is no point in living on someone elses terms and expectations.\r\n', 0),

Although not from a wealthy family, I was brought up like a little princess.\r\nI was sent to a convent school in class 1 (there was no KG or pre-school then), very early when I was just a 4-year-old. At that time, convent education was considered the best. I hated studies, did not like going to school, but had to, as my mother, who being an orphan, never got proper education, she was very firm her daughter be well-educated.\r\nIn my first ever final exam, I got all red zeros, despite which, considering, I was much too young, my teachers and family just laughed it off. Instead they even complemented me that I did go to school and looked smart in my uniform.\r\nTrue example of family support and confidence building.\r\nQ for Audience:\r\n5.	How many of you have suffered pressures of performances?\r\n6.	How many of you pressurize your children for performances?\r\n7.	What can be done to help perform better?\r\nLead with WHY to understand the pain of challenges caused by pressures. Failures are not the end of life!\r\nI was not at all a good student at most subjects except languages. \r\nWhen I was in class 6 an incident changed my entire life. I had school inspection. On being questioned about my hobby, out of fear and confusion of not knowing what to say, I started crying. On being asked the same question again, through my sobs and tears, I blurted out - ‘I collect smiles’. \r\nThe next at the morning assembly, I was called out to present myself on the dais. Petrified, I would be rusticated, once again I broke down crying. Trembling and giddy with fear, I just about managed to walk the few steps I had to, while my class teacher escorted me. \r\nMy principal comforted me and held my hand. The announcement he made next, stunned me. I was declared the winner of the inspection prize as my answer was judged the best in school. The inspector had come personally to give me the prize. “I have never heard such a beautiful answer ever before” he said. That day also happened to be my birthday. The prize I received was my best birthday gift ever. It was the turning point of my life.\r\nPositive approach often brings out the best in you.\r\nFrom that day, I started being noticed. I got better in my studies. I was also put in the dramatics group where I won another prize for best performance. I became the star of my school and my principal’s blue-eyed girl.\r\nNext, I was in class 8, when I was once chided by my school principal, who also taught us French, for not knowing an answer during his class. After class, I just marched up to his office and declared – I wish to take up Marathi instead of French. I do not accept being insulted in class. No cajoling was good enough for me to change my mind. Even at that young age, I had the courage to refuse accepting insult.\r\nDon’t let anyone run you down. Only when respect yourself first, will others respect you!\r\nWhen I grew up to be a young girl and wished to follow my dreams of becoming an air-hostess, my mother, afraid of what friends and relatives would say, said to me, “Don’t fly too high. You are a girl, you will have to burn off your wings, just like I had to do” A stunned me could not understand what being a girl had to do with not living her dream. After 2 days of silent restlessness, I went up to my mother and said, “I shall not burn my wings and I shall help you grow back yours too”. I was determined, my dreams were mine and no-one could deny them to me.\r\nThus, started my journey of self-growth from which I never looked back.\r\nNever give up your dreams!\r\n', 0),

Does not socialize. Constantly grumpy and weepy.\r\nI worked with her. After asking her some self-searching Qs, I explained to her my system and gave her my task sheet. The heading was -  We have just one life, we are born to be happy despite challenges. There exists no problem without a solution.\r\nLuckily for her, she accepted the system I showed her and followed it diligently.\r\nMet Her after a few months, she looked so much better and more cheerful.

She could work out her finances.\r\nMy data-point and my system works. It is time tested and very simple. \r\nEg 2: There was another lady very fond of travel but wouldn’t go anywhere because she had no time for herself and would not spend so much money on herself too.\r\nI worked with her asking her some soul-searching Qs about what had she ever done for herself, and how much did she value her own life and happiness. She confessed she had always put others before herself, was very duty-conscious. Despite being loved by everyone in the family and having everything, she was not happy within herself.\r\nI spoke to her about the value of the one life we all have and about the essential love and respect for one’s own life and self. Since she was doing so much for her family, she deserved to allow herself to enjoy what she loved to do. \r\nShe had the right to be happy! Routine life is very boring and energy draining, Fun in life re-energizes you. Life with Passion should be a priority.\r\nIn fact, being fond of travel, she should enjoy a good luxury wellness holiday which would also help to refresh her mind and body.\r\nExplained my system, gave her a task sheet and journal to follow.\r\nShe did work on the system.

This phase of the Invincible Influence system is about banishing limiting beliefs, changing your associations to the meeting of people and understanding that the more people you meet, the more results you get. \r\n\r\nThe next phase of the system is Instant Connection: \r\nPart of the fear of approaching people is also related to how you feel people will initially react when you do approach them.\r\nThe objective of this phase is to get someone to feel connected to you and to feel like they know you within a matter of a few seconds. Using cutting-edge body language signals, sub-conscious preparation and language pattern signals, it is possible to hack a person’s perception into feeling like they are connected to you. Combining this with NLP techniques of rapport building, this phase is all about developing an ongoing feeling of connection and rapport. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis brings me to the next phase – Rapid Reading:\r\nThis connects the last phase with the basic concept that everyone’s body has a “language” that can be read and understood once you learn how to do so. In this phase you are able to understand how a person thinks, organizes information, how best to communicate with them and what information to feed back to them. \r\n\r\nThis brings us to the Patterns of Persuasion phase –\r\nThis phase gives you a deep understanding of what it takes to persuade people, from the things that you say to how you formulate your offers, the hypnotic language patterns that you can use and more.\r\nThis phase also includes hypnotic language patterns and yes sets. \r\n\r\nThe fifth phase is Consistent Conversions:\r\nThis phase is all about moving elegantly and effectively moving a person towards taking action in a desired direction after you have planted the seeds of persuasion. \r\n\r\nFinally we have the Objection Obliterator phase:\r\nThis phase is simply about the most cutting-edge techniques to handle and overturn objections.\r\n\r\nHow the bonuses relate to the main offer – explaining my one day preview to start:\r\n\r\nThe one day preview:\r\n\r\nDuring the one day preview I would mainly cover the “instant connection” aspect of the program.

(the recording as a bonus).\r\n\r\nI cover creation of rapport through tone of voice, speed of speech and body language with excercises for each.  (I seed the rapid reading phase here by referencing that we are creating something for a person to read).\r\n\r\nI also cover pacing and leading with a metaphor about bringing a person to your way of thinking (through the metaphor I see the objection obliterator phase).\r\n\r\nAfter a day of instant connection building, I do a couple of hypnotic demonstrations that are metaphors for the other phases. \r\n\r\nI do the hypnotic arm lift that seeds the “patterns of persuasion” phase.\r\nI do a demonstration with language pattern cards that I read from while placing people into a trance.

(592, 243333, 3, 2, '•	I was bullied and made fun of.\r\n•	I was self-conscious and always wondering what people would think of me.\r\n•	I was unpopular with everyone my age (especially the girls who I so desperately wanted to be popular with!).\r\n•	I was extremely awkward in social contexts.\r\n•	I found it difficult to meet anyone new and even when I did I had no idea what to say to people.\r\n•	I couldn’t convince myself that I was good enough, let alone convince others to agree with anything I said.\r\n\r\n*( The following has been taken from my book so it is detailed and written for the reader)\r\n\r\nwhen I was about 16 years-old my life began to take a new direction, and it all started when one of the bullies had pushed me a little too far one day… \r\nI was being made fun of once again, but on that day the bully decided to condescendingly pat my face a couple of times, and for some reason something in me just snapped at that moment, and without thinking I just lashed out. \r\nI’d had enough, I had grown, and I had decided to stand up for myself. I decided it was time to take a stand once and for all, and so, at this turning point in my life in what was one of the biggest fights I’ve ever been in, I threw this punch and…\r\n… I lost the fight miserably! \r\nHowever, while I may have lost the physical battle on the day, I had won an even more important one - the battle for my self-respect, and the end of an era in which I was bullied. You see, bullies like easy targets, and once I had stood up for myself and there was a risk I would do it again, they decided to just leave me alone. \r\nAnd so I’d reached a point where I wasn’t popular, but I wasn’t necessarily unpopular either – I was just ‘there’. \r\nNow the truth is, I had always wanted to be well-liked - my father would walk around town and everyone would know him and greet him warmly, and I had cousins that were very popular, yet I knew that I was the opposite. \r\nSo I decided to start reading a little bit, just out of curiosity. I read books like How to Win Friends and Influence People, and books of jokes because I knew that people liked to hear jokes. I didn’t exactly have a strategy – I was just short on friends and long on time.\r\nI decided to start working a little on my appearance too, because I learned that although people say, “you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover”, the blunt truth is that people often do select a book based on the cover before they can make a judgement on the book’s contents. First impressions are often the most important that you make on people!\r\nSo I started working out a little, and also started wearing contact lenses (I later also had laser eye surgery, which was well worth it!). I did all this with no real expectations, just curiosity… and because I had nothing better to do. \r\nNow if you have ever experienced significant weight change, then you will understand that both you and the people around you don’t really notice anything until one day you’re so far from what you were that it just shocks you. \r\nBecause I started my journey of transformation around the people that hadn’t liked me, I didn’t see how far my skills had come until I went to university a couple of years later. When I arrived, I somehow became one of the most popular people at my whole university. I was asked to do everything and be in everything, from DJing to radio shows, and received invitations to all the various society functions. I was even elected to head up the international student committee.\r\nI didn’t even know how to explain it myself, but I was too busy enjoying it to think about it too much. No-one knew about my past, and to be honest, I am ashamed that at the time I even tried to hide it. I got rid of every picture and piece of evidence of my childhood from the age of 10 to 18. What I did know, however, is that my interest in connection, influence and persuasion had paid off.\r\nAfter university I applied for many different roles, but getting your first job is always tough. What made it tougher is that I had studied engineering, and the biggest thing I’d learned is that engineering was the last thing I wanted to do!\r\nWhilst job hunting, I stumbled across an opportunity which led to a role in door-to-door sales. I acknowledge that no-one ever goes to a great university with the aim of becoming a door-to-door salesman. In fact, it’s nobody’s first choice! I’ve never spoken at a school and heard kids saying, “When I grow up, I want to walk the streets in English weather knocking on doors for commission!” \r\nThe truth, however, it that I was extremely attracted to the role purely for the reason that it was the ultimate experience in pure persuasion – the very definition of influence and persuasion education.\r\nEverything about that role was pure persuasion genius. From the way they advertise to entice new prospects to the job (often referred to as ‘direct marketing executive’ roles), to how they get people excited to join the role on their own accord, it was amazing how they would turn a person from wondering if this was something they should do to hoping they get selected to fill the role. \r\nWhat excited me the most, though, was that the people who were there and the ones who were training me were some of the most positive and charismatic people I had ever met. And… they had a ‘system’. The system that I teach you in this book has evolved from that very system I learned in those days. \r\nThe difference between those old sales techniques and the sophisticated methods I teach you today is that I have modified it all based on all my research into many other systems, and I have incorporated tried-and-tested NLP and hypnotic patterns into the principles while ensuring that everything that applies does so for both the digital and real world.\r\nThe origins of these principles were based on a system that I initially learned and thereafter taught, and were the basis for creating some of the top door-to-door salespeople in the whole of the UK.\r\nI wouldn’t say I was the fastest learner, but I was super keen, and I had a passion for learning how to relate to people instantly and getting people to do what I wanted. I had spent so many years feeling helpless that this felt like learning a super power. \r\nAfter just a few months I rose to become one of the top salespeople in the whole of the UK, a field of many thousands of people – no small feat for an Omani boy living so far from home. When salespeople do well in the field they are then asked to train others, and you are slowly given a team to build which can increase your income. \r\nAfter making a few mistakes with my first few trainees, I realized that the trick to building a team that constantly performs is to develop a system that works for every person, every time. The company had its own system, and I just had to build on that slightly to go further than the others. So, I developed a system that allowed me to train people into becoming some of the top salespeople in the country as well. \r\nIt took some trial and error, and I had trained people who became exceptional at sales. Then came a day that I had trained a person who became the number one salesperson in the UK just one week after joining the company. This is when I knew that I had an amazing system that anyone could use, and I could teach anyone to be the best! I fell in love with systems because they are transferable, while people are not.\r\nI understood that for me to have a successful team, everyone had to do well, and for everyone to do well in my team, I needed a strong system – it was not about me being strong, it was about my system being strong.\r\n\r\nAfter two years in the field of door-to-door sales, I moved on to bigger and better things:\r\n* I worked for an airline conducting corporate sales in South Africa, combining my love of travel with my love of influence and persuasion. I learned here the differences between a consumer selling environment and a corporate selling environment.\r\n* Following this I moved to Bahrain and into a marketing role. Although marketing contained persuasion, I was initially dissatisfied with the role, and I started looking for ways to increase my income. \r\n* I started an online business – this was a new challenge because when I did door to door sales, I had a product that applied to every home, and when I worked in corporate sales, I was told which businesses my product applied to and I knew where to go.\r\nWhen I created my online business, I realized that I could not just promote to every person I saw; it was a specific product that certain people would be interested in, though not everyone. I decided that I needed to learn how to work smarter and not harder, and so started learning digital marketing; essentially how to find people online who are looking for what you have. \r\nIf you ever want to be very good at something very quickly, put your own money on the line when you don’t have much of it! Trust me: investing in yourself makes you get efficient real quick – you don’t want to spend a spare dime that could have gone towards buying food or possibly even socks (socks have always been a very holy item for me… and I don’t mean in the religious sense!).\r\nI had to learn quickly how to optimize my ads and apply influence and persuasion to an online and digital world. This was also at a time in the Middle East where many businesses hadn’t even heard of online marketing.\r\nI soon found that the systems that I had learned previously for influence and persuasion still applied, though they needed to be adjusted slightly because of the format. I also learned new elements that I had not been aware of before. \r\nMany online marketers teach you how to build an online business – sales people teach how to sell offline. I had to develop my own system to combine the two using the most effective elements of prospecting online and converting offline. \r\nAfter two years of promoting my business and gaining customers that spanned a number of countries in the Middle East and Africa, all of a sudden one day the product got discontinued.\r\nThis was a huge blow for me – Two years of my life building a business. TWO YEARS! \r\nI am a positive person and I worked hard to find the positive spins for myself, but believe me it was tough… I told myself: “This will make my success story even more compelling!” And, “I have learned things that are extremely valuable.” Et cetera, et cetera.\r\nFortunately, the next stage appeared almost instantly. It’s important to remember at this point that even if someone takes an opportunity away from you, they can never take the skills that you have gained. \r\nAlmost immediately after my setback, I was headhunted to head up the digital marketing for a global brand, and then headhunted again to do it for another even bigger global brand. I held a senior position and had gained corporate success, applying my knowledge online for these major brands.\r\nThere was a catch though: After spending some time initially building and setting things up while learning the ins and outs of the role, it quickly became a fairly monotonous task, because I realised that I was no longer:\r\n-Learning new things any more,\r\n-Actually helping people better their lives,\r\n-Subjected to new and cutting-edge influence and persuasion techniques.\r\nThis realisation led me down the path of starting to learn NLP and hypnosis. After all, I had learned and applied so much influence and persuasion, yet I had never conducted a deep study into the science of human behavior. At the time Dr Richard Bandler, the co-creator of NLP, happened to be teaching the subject, so I felt that I should go and learn from the best.\r\nThis opened my eyes to a whole new level of persuasion and influence at a subconscious level. The ability to make lifelong changes in an instant felt insanely powerful. As an example, I learned to cure phobias in 10 minutes. Lifelong phobias! At the time I was terrified of snakes – growing up I wasn’t even able to look at a snake on TV. Toy snakes used to terrify me. \r\nThen I went to this seminar, and was taught how to cure a phobia. The next thing I knew we were separated into groups to test our learning. There was the ‘snake’ group, the ‘spider’ group, the ‘heights’ group, the ‘claustrophobia’ group and the ‘needle’ group.\r\nSo there I was, extremely nervous as I was told that in 12 minutes I would be asked to hold a snake, and I was wondering, “Can I do this?” We’d learned the steps to the technique in theory, but we had not yet practiced the technique. I was paired with a woman who was actually crying her eyes out, which didn’t help the fact that I was probably close to crying myself… \r\nAnyhow, we composed ourselves enough to do the exercises, and within 15 minutes we were both standing there with snakes on our shoulders, and the hugest smiles on our faces because of the breakthrough we had achieved. \r\nThat moment was pivotal for me, because it was then that I truly realized how powerful the subconscious mind could be in changing our long-term beliefs and behaviors, whereas previously in that situation I would have had to just change my pants…\r\nThis newfound field re-ignited my passion for learning, discovering and helping people. I started travelling the world to learn from many of the best out there about the field of influencing the subconscious mind. I studied, hypnosis, NLP, hypnotherapy, conversational hypnosis, mind-bending language, instant inductions, street hypnosis performances and more.\r\nAfter studying so much and learning from the best, and reading so many influence and persuasion books, I started to reach a point where I would read things and notice that people would either miss things out or get things wrong, and I slowly began to realise that I too could contribute so much to this field. \r\n', 0),

(606, 224655, 3, 1, 'First 2 - Months programme - The Influence Set - Here the participant realises how his parents, community, mass media and society have influenced the participant\'s thoughts, feelings and decisions so that they can practice appropriate assignments to break that circle of influence.\r\n\r\nStep 1 - Induction 1-0-1 coaching\r\nThe participants go through a process called Nadi Pariksha so that I can help them identify the root cause of their anger, resentment, frustration and hurt feelings.\r\n\r\nAssignment 1- Creating your blueprint\r\nParticipants will be encouraged to create a blueprint. A lack of a blueprint can leave a person angry and frustrated.\r\n\r\nOutcome - \r\nA blueprint will help induce a deep belief in their own dignity, their worth and their own some bodiness. When any anybody makes them feel that they’re nobody, they will always feel that they count. They will always feel that they are worthy, and will always feel that their life has ultimate significance.\r\n\r\nSecondly, with creation of their life’s blueprint they will have as the basic principle the determination to achieve excellence in their various fields of endeavour. They will be deciding as the days, as the years unfold what they will do in life — what their life’s work will be. And they will set out to do it the best way.\r\n\r\nAssignment 2 - Creating your Vision\r\nA vision is a ultimate realisation of what you will begin. Vision is large, huge. It can be accomplished by first taking steps to plan it in detail. A vision must be divided into goals. goals are your milestones. And goals need objectives. Objectives are the bullet points describing what you will do to achieve your goals. By accomplishing your goals, you will ultimately realise your vision. Your vision is yours but not about you. Without a vision a person can be left frustrated and angry.\r\n\r\nOutcome -\r\nThis assignment will help them create a vision that they will begin by first writing their vision in detail. They will divide it into goals and objectives so that they can plan to create their lives in the best way.\r\n\r\nAssignment 3 - Your belief and behaviour create your outcome\r\nThe beliefs that you carry from childhood create your behaviour and that will influence the outcome of your life be it your relationships, your marriage, your family, your work and your life.\r\n\r\nOutcome - \r\nThis assignment will help them realise that they have been repeating their beliefs and behaviour unconsciously and have been affecting their relationship with their partners, creating rifts in their families as well as in their work.\r\n\r\nAssignment 4 - Your belief about your community influences your outcome\r\nThe beliefs of your community unconsciously influences your belief and behaviour and affects your outcome.\r\n\r\nOutcome - \r\nThis assignment will help them realise that they have been influenced by how their community and surroundings and how that has affected their efforts to build harmonious relationships with their partners, in their family as well as their work.\r\n\r\nAssignment 5 - Your beliefs from Mass Media and Social behaviour will influence your outcome\r\nThe beliefs of mass media and social behaviour unconsciously influences and affects your relationships, your family as well as your work.\r\n\r\nOutcome - \r\nThis assignment will help them realise that they have been influenced by how mass media and social behaviour unconsciously influences them and affects the outcome of their efforts to build healthy relationships with their partners, in their families as well as their work.\r\n\r\nAssignment 6 - Prioritiing Roles\r\nWe take on the roles of husband/boyfriend, wife/girlfriend, father/mother, friend, businessman, volunteer, citizen, employee and so on.\r\n\r\nTo become a complete and well-rounded person, we need to give our best in each of our roles. So much of our happiness depends on our success in our various roles in life. But before you can figure out how to excel in each aspect of your life, you first need to clearly define your roles. When we do not live our roles, we may enact these roles in other relationships which may leave us at risk of jeopardising our relationships.\r\n\r\nOutcome -\r\nThis assignment with help participants realise the roles they are playing unconsciously and will help them overcome these roles with tagged assignments so that they can create new roles that they need to play out through their relationships, families and at their work.\r\n\r\nNext 2 Months - This is all about overcoming the habit of judging others or from being the victim of judgment. In both cases, anger is used habitually to either abuse or in reaction.\r\n\r\nStep 1 - Induction 1-0-1 coaching\r\nThe participants go through a process called Nadi Pariksha so that I can help them identify the root cause of their anger, resentment, frustration and hurt feelings. Old participants will know how their practice has improved their beliefs, behaviour and outcomes.\r\n\r\nAssignment 1 - What does your anger want?\r\nAnger is your attempt to solve a problem by seizing control of someone or something. Your anger at your partner shows that you are preparing to control your partner’s behaviour. And your partner\'s anger at you may affect your behaviour.\r\n\r\nOutcome -\r\nThis assignment will help the participant realise how they have reacted so that they can rectify their behaviour through the assignment and change their behaviour for ever by building their new habits.\r\n\r\nAssignment 2 - Turning Judgmental thinking into factual thinking\r\nWhen we deal with any anger problem, it helps to remember that anger is about control. Anger is a habit. Habits die if they are not practiced. The reason we feel as if other people cause our anger is that the habit is so readily available. Angry thoughts and feelings seem as if they just “pop up” in certain circumstances. It feels as if the people or circumstances that are present “make” the anger “pop up.” But it is our habit of being critical that keeps anger warm and ready.\r\n\r\nOutcome -\r\nThe outcome of this assignment will be to help the participant identify how they have been habitually judging their partner and how that is causing anger to exist in their relationship. The assignment also helps them overcome their anger habit by converting their judgment into factual judgment and this practice helps them stop participating in their anger habit.\r\n\r\nFinal 2 Months Programme - This is all about increasing interactive communication with partner and reducing self importance and building gratitude and doing what needs to be done.\r\n\r\nStep 1- Step 1 - Induction 1-0-1 coaching\r\nThe participants go through a process called Nadi Pariksha so that I can help them identify the root cause of their anger, resentment, frustration and hurt feelings. Old participants will know how their practice has improved their beliefs, behaviour and outcomes.\r\n\r\nAssignment 1 - Increasing interactive communication in your relationship\r\nEvery relationship will have some transactional elements. However, most of the communication in a relationship must be interactional so that there is freedom of choice and no promises.\r\n\r\nOutcome - \r\nThe outcome of this assignment is to help the participant identify their communication methods that cause them to criticise their partner so that they can change that behaviour by building interactive communication in their relationship.\r\n\r\nAssignment 2 - Imaginary and Real Relationships\r\nYour real relationships are made up of the actual interactions you have—the way you talk with one another, the way you treat each other—and the values you place on one another as demonstrated through placement of trust or distrust, demonstrated gratitude or demonstrated demands. Real relationships are made up of how people behave toward one another.\r\n\r\nThe real relationship consists of how you actually treat each other plus your actual feelings toward one another. \r\n\r\nAn imaginary relationship is made up of what you tell yourself about how you feel toward the other person and what you tell yourself about how the other person feels toward you. Spouses may have angry feelings day in and day out toward their partners, may treat them as enemies, but still imagine that they love them.\r\n\r\nOutcome - \r\nThis assignment will help participants look at their relationships openly and without judgment and take steps to identify imaginary feelings and remove them and replace them with real feelings.\r\n\r\nAssignment 3 - Replacing Argument with Communication\r\nThe goal of communication is to exchange information. The goal of anger is to control another person’s behaviour. Words can be used for both communication and anger, but they can’t be used for both in the same relationship.\r\n\r\nOutcome - \r\nThe outcome of this assignment will be that the participants will be able to replace their argumentative methods of communication into peaceful communication.\r\n\r\nAssignment 4 - Substituting Good intentions with Good actions\r\nExamine your most important relationship by asking yourself, “What do I intend to do, but do not follow through on?” You will find these unfulfilled intentions in thoughts about what your relationship is like; that is, in your imaginary relationship.\r\n\r\nOutcome - \r\nThis assignment helps the participants take concrete steps towards bridging the gap between having a good intention towards the partner to creating a positive outcome out of their action with the spouse.\r\n\r\nAssignment 5 - Identifying my Self Importance in my Major Relationships\r\nThis assignment helps the participants identify where they are acting out of self importance and not from self-respect so that they can convert their self importance into gratitude.\r\n\r\nOutcome -\r\nThe outcome of this assignment is to convert self importance into gratitude and cultivating gratitude in their relationships. \r\n\r\nAssignment 6 - Converting all relationships from attachment to love\r\nThis assignment will help to convert attachment into love and base the relationships on trust instead of transaction.\r\n\r\nOutcome -\r\nThe participants will be able to reduce attachment in a relationship to just love. Love will allow each of their partners to express freely without fear of being judged or controlled.', 0),

In this regard, generally extroverts have it really easy. On the other hand introverted, shy and reserved people, face difficulty in three major area of life i.e. Job, Business & relationships. These people have a hard time connecting and gelling in with people, building rapport, leading a team, making tough decisions and most possibly without any fault of their own lead a lonely life. Quite reserved and often detached from society their social skills goes for a toss, which is of so much importance in the world we live in today. All this because they just lack the confidence in themselves that they can do it.   In the words of Late Jim Rohn “what you don’t use, you lose”. So over time, unknown to them, this detachment, results in anxiety when they go out, self-doubt, low self-confidence, inability to make decision and eventually lose their leadership traits altogether. As a result they lose out on umpteen opportunities in professional, business and as well as in personal life. In the professional field, the lack of good rapport with his/her boss can most likely result in him/her not getting the promotion or worst getting fired. In their personal life, he/she may struggle to properly convey his/her love to their dream girl/boy, and in doing so might coming off as “weird” or “desperate”. Eventually their love will end up with some other guy/girl. In both cases, all the shy guy/gals can do, is to sit back alone in his/her room, crying to him/herself and complain about his/hers sheer bad luck. \r\nBut we all know, that’s not the real problem. Luck, never was the problem. Their lack of confidence is. Being born unconfident is not your fault but if you die Blaming luck or god for not giving them the natural confidence like others is ok, but it won’t help.  Their lack of effort to go out and get the skills necessary, is the problem. They never did anything to get lucky in the first place. For Example - If you sit for your exam without preparation, you will fail. There’s no luck there. Some people are born talented and some get it through pure smart & hard work. These are facts of life. Accept it & as Tony Robbins say “take massive action” to get over your problems. Don’t whine. You have to fight for the things you want. And unfortunately this problem of low confidence will always be inside them, till the time they choose to face their fears, fight off procrastination and dare to take the massive actions, that is required, to become the one they always wanted to be.

I got my opportunity to start my own business and at the age of 19 I inaugurated my first independent business of computer education which was running in profits from day one. \r\nAfter enjoying the success for couple of years the global recession impacted in very low business for me.

(648, 374184, 5, 2, 'Story 1 (REINVENT YOUR LIFE)\r\n	One of my client was suffering with debts from many years. When I was working with him one on one I discovered that in spite of having a good job with remarkable salary he used to end up in debt paying various monthly bills from many years. After few sessions I found that he was deeply in pain that as he is divorced and leaves alone he was not having any purpose for his LIFE. And due to this he was never having the aim to earn for tomorrow. His vision about his life was just about earning to fulfill today’s needs. Just earning and spending it right away for being alive today. \r\nI helped him reinvent his purpose of Life using the system of my program and within few months he was out of his debt ridden situation. Not only overcoming debts but he bought a High end Bike for himself. He started enjoying his work, his life. Within a years’ time period he upgraded from a second hand car to a brand new Sedan for himself. He started enjoying the feeling of having enough balance amount in his account even in the time of month ends. His life started flourishing. The system works and this system had transformed a debt ridden person into a happy go lucky well to do man by helping Him REINVENT the PURPOSE of his LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nStory 2 (Overcome LIMITING BELIEFS/FEARS)\r\nI have worked with many people globally. This reminds me about my client in Bengaluru. He was a very talented astrologer and vastu consultant. He was getting good clients in his consultancy and he decided to take his talent on a larger platform by conducting workshops and seminars to share his knowledge with large audience. \r\nIn one of the session with him I discovered that he was having the fear that his lack of mastery over communicating in English Language will lead to his failure. During over session I implemented my system and empowered him to overcome his fear and he overcame the belief about being unable to communicate in English. Instead he got empowered with the advantage of communicating in regional language or Hindi language. He also overcame his stage fear which was result of this limiting belief.  Today he is conducting his seminars all over the country with full halls flooded with audiences and getting very huge success. I once again got my system tested and proven by helping him through my system to overcome his limiting beliefs.\r\n\r\nStory 3 (RELATIONSHIP BUILDING)\r\nIn one of my client cases I happened to work with a client who used to get lot of new enrollments but used to fail to get re engagements by the same or previous clients. She was a share broker and working with clients who used to do share trading through her. From many, many years she was just a good friend of mine and used to share her ordeals and experiences with me regularly.  Once she happened to drop in one of my program going on in her vicinity. After attending the seminar she just walked straight to me and said that she wants to register for the program.  \r\nWhen we worked out through all the areas we found that she was unable to establish strong bonding relationship with her clients. And due to this she used to fail in retaining her existing customers for longer duration of time. She was able to get through the system of my program and learned the skills and techniques to establish and maintain harmonious relationships professionally as well as in personal life too. Slowly and steadily she was having sound bonding with her clients, her confidence increased. She was getting more business now with more engagements from the same existing client base. As she was very good at her skills regarding share trading just enhancing her relationship management skills yielded a bigger game changer for her success.\r\n\r\nStory 4 (REPROGRAM YOUR MINDSET)\r\nIn my journey I have worked and trained with many of my employees. I remember one of my employee who had joined as a trainee to assist in the admin work and was getting low salary as he was not employed in the right job position as per his skills and talents. The problem with him was that he was having wrong programming in his mind about his eligibility and capability. He was having the knowledge of hardware and software’s on which he could train other people and do a more skillful job which he was capable of. He had failed in one of the subjects at graduation level academic examination. And as he was not having degree certificate in his hand he had the wrong programming in his mind that he is unfit for doing the job of trainer.\r\nWhile observing his knowledge in the field I discovered his skills and counselled him for overcoming his wrong mind programming due to which he was doing trainee job and terming himself unqualified. I helped him reprogram his mindset through my system and offered him opportunity to work as a trainer in my other venture. He followed the system undoubtedly for few months and he successfully reprogrammed his mindset. He joined immediately and was really training people successfully and the clients were also very satisfied. Further he completed his graduation and post-graduation and after working in my firm for few years he graduated in his career as a successful entrepreneur with his own business. Today whenever I happen to meet him I really feel proud that I have transformed a budding Life into a success story by reprogramming  HIS MINDSET  through this system.\r\n\r\nStory 5 (CRAFT YOUR WEALTH BLUEPRINT FOR A BILLIONAIRE FORTUNE)\r\nThere are many stories if my clients getting transformed into multi-millionaires, billionaires. One case which is very close to my heart is of my life partner my husband. He was brought up in a typical mediocre life style fully conditioned and programmed for getting educated and stepping into the shoes for following family tradition of being an employee lifelong. He started his journey with a job of medical representative after his graduation. When we got married he was earning peanuts for working out throughout his entire day and many times night also. \r\nBeing married to an entrepreneur he used to accompany me in my business and enjoy working for our own business. His blueprint was changing working in my system. Over a period of 3 years he was transformed so much that he created his own opportunity to start his entrepreneurial journey. He started his career with 4 digit salary and I have experienced him transform following my system blindfolded that today he is a billionaire with many ventures in real estate, trading, training, manufacturing, marketing, overseas ventures etc.\r\nI have experienced his transformation very closely where he followed through my system whole heartedly, adding his strategies and making my system more robust and tested.\r\n', 0),

Teaching you the same to do it for yourself. \r\n\r\nMy story. I need to tell what problems I faced, how people treated me, how I felt & what kind of mental blocks were formed because of that which eventually crippled me. Then how I identified them, slowly changed them, & started doing things & literally made fun of myself in front of them. So I did what I never did to get something I had never got all this time. And it took me 5 years to get to where I am today. But if I was true, I would say it say it actually took me a year to get here. Confused?? I will explain. In the first 4 years I was doing anything and just randomly doing stuff (Give examples of stuff I did). But it was not something that was consistent. It was a lot of trial and error. Its only in the last one year I figured out what skills I lacked and what activities nd set of believe in need to inculcate in myself to get what I want. (To connect with anyone everyone and anytime.. specially girls!!). But those activities wear not normal activities. It required me to go out all alone and get ridiculed by people. I only wished if only I had some kind of support. And in doing so I started seeing a pattern. A specific pattern of mindshifts & activities which when done in a proper sequence breaks the limiting believes and when done over a period of time like a l=month or so, makes it permanent. After the initial push, it start the changes in you.. and over the following days & weeks an months you keep growing becoming the one you wear destined to be. The all confident and fearless person who gives a damn what people thinks about him and has the courage to can talk, connect & influence people anywhere anytime and with anyone, at will.\r\nAnd then when they become that person what all things can they do which was earlier seemed impossible for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n4th Gap – Making the Offer & People should be going “I wonder how much I have to pay for transforming myself”, Followed by “Oh okay.. its not that cheap but I can invest that much atleast to fix my life..

Connect with Audience: ETR in short\r\n-	I tell my story – Focusing on the mindshifts that actually started the change in me. The mindshifts that I am going to share here will help the clients to make a decision at the time when I am going to make my offer few hours from now. These mindshifts are actually seeding. These are counter thoughts to the negative thoughts that my clients will go through when I make the offer.\r\n6.

How that thought process had crippled me then with an example and how changing threat thought process has helped me easily pull through seemingly tough situations.\r\n•	How a person natural at this will effortlessly sail through problems and a peoson who doesn’t have these skills will fail to do so. But it can be learnt. That’s the only way to be at par with the extroverts, for whom all these thingsare really easy. One can go from story A to the story B Give two contrasting stories. \r\n•	Sharing - Call up a peoson from the audience who want to share their story.

Be it with your boss or the girl/guy you like?\r\nCan you relate to the awkard feeling you get in your body every time you go out?\r\nHow it feels to be riddled with indecision & utter lack of leadership skills, which is hampering your professional & personal life. Does People not respect you anymore ??\r\nDoes it not occur to you that women like leadership & courage in their man?  \r\nDo you feel like a misfit in society?\r\nDo you think your shy nature has stopped you from enjoying life to the fullest?\r\nI do. I feel the pain and frustation that only lonely person feel. I was the guy who deliberately stayed away form the lime light. Shy & Reserved. Couldn’t to talk to anyone and could never make friends with anyone. I tried to be perfect so that people wont have any complains against me. So I end up being uptight & rigid. I become the “weird” guy in class. Guys ridiculed me & girls hated me. Some did pity on me. Lucky me !! I eventually managed to make a best friend and that’s all I had back then. In school, Every one was part of a group. Except me. I used to bounce from one group to another, searching for acceptance from anyone and in whatsoever manner. I was Desperate for acceptance. But never got one. I was very nice to people. So nice that I helped them with their work at the cost of mine. The thought that if you are nice people will be nice to you dominated my actions. But this strategy did pay off but not in the way I expected. People seemed nicer to me just to get their work done. I lost all respect and people took me for granted. And as years went by this lack of social skills hit me ways I could have never imagined.\r\nI could not speak up & could not muster up the courage to do the things that other peoepl did very easily. I could not make friends and was was alone all my life. I was the guy who would stay in the corner awat form the priving eyes of everybody when everyone is enjoying, but I was too scared to go out and have fun. Even though I was there with my group I was invisible. No one bothered about me. If I came or not. That’s because no want really wanted me to be a part of it. Without any leadership or decesin skills I was just a burden n the group. Girls found me weird, and never crossed my path. I was weak and had difficulty saying no to people so I ended up doing things I don’t like for people I despised. I was the one who was the joke of the group. I was the one who got bullied and people enjoyed it. Being form a conservative family I could never share these with my parents. My confidence went for a toss. \r\n In college again i got sIdelines as the weird guy. I burnt with envy day in day out at the guys who were the center of attention for everyone. Everybody, specially girls seem to like them more than me. I could not figure out for the life of me why that was so. I went into my professional world and the same promlem of lack of social skills haunted me as I get sacked from job for not able to maintain clent relationships and also the relatiosnsjhips with my immediate boss. Even htough I worked harder, I could not get good rapport with my boss as well. Even during pitching for my business I could never convince people of my idea. No points for guessing that I had no love life. This simple lack of social skill was ruining my llife and I had to do something about it and the kick came as a outright rejection from my crush as she destroyed my heart by insulting me for being a bore. This was 2012. And since then I vowed to myself that never again will anyone get bored with me, take me for granted. I will do whats necessary and get the skills that are required. No excuses!! \r\nOver the last 5 years I invested heavily in myself and did crazy things to get my social life back. Get my social skills back Fast forward 5 years, Now I am standing on this stage. I am actually standing on this stage and I feel I am someone. I never thought I could ever do this kind of stuff, but again that’s the power of compounding. Its now my lifes mission helping people to solve their problem of lack of social skills with the system that I had developed during my struggling years and transform the shy & lonely people into lively and confident peole with whom everyone now wants to hang around with. This a program which changes you from inside out & permantly. Not a program about talk to girl or stranger in 5 mins. 5 mins?? Ya right 5 min. My question is what do you do after that 5 mins. So thers are lot of bullshit stuff out their which brings no permanent change in you. Just a feell good factor at best & may be a minor improvement temporarily. Bcoz you are fixing the symptons not the problem. The problem is not that you cannt connect with people, that’s the symptom. The problem is much deeper into you mind. Its self doubt, low self esteem & confidence among others. Change that, and the connections will happen. This program is about making you a natural from inside out. Its not just about the talk.

Neither his parents, friends or life partners. I have to say this story from 1st person view. \r\nDelivery: Making them understand that no one is going to tell you to Invest in yourself bcoz they are afraid that you will grow & become someone better than them. So people will tell you not to do that. They want you to be as midyorker in life like they are. That’s human nature. And they don’t do it consciously. They will say its for your betterment & tell you to follow their advise. They will make it sound very logical & good, but deep down they don’t want you to succeed more than them. We all have this inside us. So they will logically try to play you down. (Weave my story around this idea & how I did the things I had to to get where I am today. Bcoz if I had not listened to my voice I will be still be living that miserable life, and that so called “friends” or your near or dear one  would tell you that things will get better, at the same time happy & laughing inside at you thinking that you are not better then them & feel proud for themselves for having stopped you from rising above them. (Story – Here Focus on How I did not take no for an answer & today I am here)\r\nB)	Seeding 2: A confident and bold makes one attractive. And an attractive person is liked by all. Both men & women. You cant select whom to be confident with. You need to be natuarally condident at all times. Otherwise people will take you as a fake.\r\nThot being attacked : I just want to be confident with girls not with guys. I just want to know how to be attractive and talk to girls only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC)	Seeding 3 : Compound effect. One shift makes a hell of a difference.\r\nThot being attacked: I cant change myself. Such skills are either I have it or don’t. Can’t be acquired.. destiny is sealed for me when I was born. \r\nObjective: So that they “logically” understand & believe that that they can change & my system will work for them\r\nDelivery: Explain the benefits compounding can bring into their life. Give the money example. Re .1 paise vs Rs 1 Cr. The guy who drinks Vs the guy who is growing every single day. (This 4 days will be the one much needed shift from their current life style & the following 3 months will be the growing time) Objective: To make them understand that what I am doing is genuine & Give them the way to think out for themselves that what I am doing will benefit them. They shuld come to this conclusion by themselves. So step 1 is to Make them understand how the compound effect works – And step 2 is to put forward my system as a tool that starts that compounding process in themselve – So that in few months of constant growth they become a confident person \r\nD)	Optional seeding: You can only grow when you have been down and out. A person with born abilities never gives imporatance to their qualities. So you (Audience) know the pain of being in this loneliness & halplessness & hence you will make best use of the \r\nE)	Seeding 4: There a difference bet an “asset” and things you buy. Not all things you buy are your asset. You are Your own asset. Don’t spend on yourself rather Invest & investing more than Rs 1 lakh on yourself is really really worth it. You have to invest in yourself to get a “permanent” return. \r\nThot being attacked : Are you mad ??Who spends so much on an intangible program like this ?? I rather buy an iphone.\r\nObjective:  My clients should be ready/comfortable in their head with the idea of investing massively on themselves to get the results they want. \r\nDelivery: What benefit does an Iphone give you.. Bcoz all features are there in all phones. U buy it for Status? Being someone important? N if that’s the case.. y not improve yourself to becme actually important. To have real Status. That will grow every single day. Whereasa  an Iphones value will decrease everyday. Give an account of how much I spent in growing & becoming the person I am today. How much did i invest to get the life I want. N if I can do it. They can too. (But I should not tell them to invest on their face.. I just share my story. This will serve as a reference for the prospective clients when I make the actual offer.

(678, 367608, 3, 2, 'My father met with an accident when I was 5 years old and hospitalized for close to 2 years. He had to undergo 17 major operations and those were tough times for the family. From all perspectives, financial and emotional, my Mom was running the show for us. My parents always knew the importance of education and even in troubled times; they did not stop my schooling. I am so grateful to them for everything in life.\r\n\r\nThough I was among the toppers, post my engineering, I struggled to get a decent job and it took almost 3 years to find something suitable for myself. It was never about finding a job; it was about the RIGHT job that matched with my capabilities and skills.\r\n\r\nSo while was I doing great at work in terms of experience and exposure, being on maternity twice in 2003 and 2005, the corporate policies like bell curve normalization leading to low ratings, office politics, and changes in promotions policies started impacting me, somewhere the system and processes started hurting.\r\nI decided to quit as an employee, stay at home, and do something on my own rather than being unhappy in my workplace.\r\n\r\nI worked on my priorities in life at that point in time. I had to take care of my babies, I needed to spend more time at home and if I can also work doing all this was what was needed to be worked upon.\r\n\r\nThat meant I had to find new opportunities or create one for myself.\r\n\r\nMy colleague used to call me Million Dollar Baby and that I am a true “gujju” with business blood flowing within me. I also at times felt, I have a certain knack for business as I generate a lot of ideas spontaneously.\r\n\r\nAll I needed was to execute my ideas in real time, not continue to execute them only in my thoughts.\r\n\r\nAn action was required and not just thinking or talking about doing something!\r\n\r\nExplored the market to see what I could venture in, wanted to start a Restaurant or open a retail showroom, but upon working out the numbers on paper with the money I had, it did not work out in terms of margins until break even happens.\r\n\r\nAnkur (my life & business partner) rallied my energy & came along. With his ideas & knowledge, his business acumen, his financial planning, his approach to life & business, we created a masterpiece of our life as entrepreneurs. It definitely takes two to tango. We complement each other in our skills & make an awesome powerful duo combo as partners.\r\n\r\nWhen both of us left our jobs, we had two daughter\'s 3 yr & 1 yrs old & since we did not any loans (car/home), it was relatively simpler to let go of our jobs. Everyone in our network thought we are crazy & discouraged us, but we believed in ourselves & did not let negativity around us rule/ruin us. We took inputs, but did what we felt was right to do!\r\n\r\nWe decided to leverage on our professional skills that we acquired being in IT for almost a decade before starting our own IT firm and that is how we started our journey as Entrepreneurs in December 2006 with Meteonic Innovation (www.meteonic.com).\r\n\r\nThis was just the beginning of what life has in store for us.\r\n\r\nMeteonic our IT firm was our first venture as entrepreneurs & in last 11 years of entrepreneurship journey we have ventured in 7 diverse businesses, some sold, some failed, some running successfully.\r\n\r\nI have grown so much in my life since I became an Entrepreneur, not just in Business/professional aspects of life, but personally & spiritually too.\r\n\r\nInfact there was so much growth in my personal thought process w.r.t to health & fitness, direction of my intelligence, Emotional Maturity, the way I have looked at Life, inside out & outside in !\r\n\r\nMy awareness about what really matters to me w.r.t to my Values, Beliefs & my character\r\n\r\nThough I was always spitually aligned, the knowing came after my spirtual retreat where I figured out Why am i still breathing ?

I went close to her to offer her some money and could see fluids were cming out of her eyes, I asked her what happened to your eyes. She said its paining. Than i aksed her to go to a doctor, she said she don’t have anyone to go with. I said ok i will take you, she holded my hand and said when you will take me. I said tomorrow morning at 6 am to eye hospital, which is suppose to be the best eye hospital in guwahati. Next morning i was surprised i could get up in time and went and saw her sitting on the same place i left her in the evening, she was just waiting for me. I took her to hospital and was full day doing all the tests one after another, the next day again, the same more tests were done. On the third day i had to do my packing as after a day i was supose to go back, so some specialist were supposed to be consulted as i was left out with so much of work, i posted on my friends group if someone can come and help her in hospital, but only one answer came all were busy, all they offered me is money. Do you think money was required? No. Most of the big hospitals take care of poor people’s treatment as a charity. Ofcourse, time is more costly than money in today’s time.

How many of you would like to have a memorable conversation with anyone?\r\n6.	How many of you would not? \r\n\r\nGreat! Let me tell you why am I here today. There was a time I was just like a lot of you here.  I would communicate with a lot of people, but found it difficult to connect with them. I was not shy or afraid to communicate, but I still found myself struggling to connect to people. \r\nI would talk to someone one day and the next day they forgot me. I had to start the conversation all over again, to remind them who I was, what I did, why we communicated, what I wanted from them etc. This used to irritate me a lot. \r\nOn the other hand I saw others in and around me who would connect to others effortlessly. I kept wondering what was I doing wrong? Why am I not able to strike a conversation that leads to a life long connection? How can I use my own characteristics to establish an automatic connected relationship? \r\n\r\nLet me tell you a story. When I started my first business I had to talk to a lot of rural artisans and craftsman. Now people who have worked with rural artisans and craftsman would know how they function. \r\n\r\nIs there anyone in the room who has interacted or worked with rural artisans and craftsman? \r\n\r\nIf there is someone in the room, then I communicate with them. And ask them to validate what I am saying. If no, I encourage them to interact with rural artisans and craftsman and validate what I am saying. \r\n\r\nSo the rural artisans and craftsman are quite protective about their skills and art. They want to make sure that their art and crafts are not being misused. They also want genuine people to work with them. They don’t allow people to visit their workshop that easily, unless you are a big-ticket buyer. My challenge was to build a connection with them in such a way that we could not visit their workshops so that I can learn the processes from the right people, but also I should be able to convince them to give us products of smaller quantity. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think would have happened? Allow people to come up with answers. \r\n\r\nInitially I struggled; I wouldn’t get that welcoming response from them. I would struggle to communicate with them, leave alone connection. They refused to even have a straight conversation, leave alone striking business deal. Then I did something completely different. I changed my outlook; I changed the way I was connecting with them. I worked on understanding what they needed vs what I was looking for. This time I went back to them as a different person, and guess what it worked. I not only communicated with them, I connected with them so much so that even now they call me to tell me new products have arrived. They call me to discuss their problems with me. They give me much lesser quality of products in the same bulk price they give to others. \r\n\r\nWhat did I do different this time? Well, I applied some of the techniques that I will be teaching in my program with them and it worked. \r\n\r\nAll this happened to me even though I was not an introvert. I was not shy or reluctant to talk to people. Imagine what would have happened if I were shy and introvert? \r\n\r\n11.05am – 11.30am: VIP Ticket Seeding [Through a story of mine]\r\n\r\nQuestions to be asked: \r\n1.

How many of you believe you deserve to go ahead in life, and make awesome connections?\r\n5.	Then what is stopping you from making you take the action to become the very important person? \r\n\r\nBefore the session ends: If you really think you deserve to be very important person, then go ahead and ask my team to give you that VIP pass, which will help you get some private time with me.

As part of these sessions I meet a lot of people. During one such session I met one lady, her husband signed her up for the event. She was not sure until that day morning whether she wanted to attend it or not. She came only because of the push from her husband. However, during the event she shared that she is scared of coming to public events or conversing with strangers because she feels her English is bad. \r\nI said so what? She can converse in her mother tongue. My Kanada is equally bad I can’t speak a bit. She is doing great in terms of that. She got emotional because of the acceptance she got from me, the way I connected with her. \r\n\r\nHumorous Story:\r\n\r\nThis is when I met my husband for the first time. Characteristically we are very different, if I am fire he is ice! \r\nI had been to Chennai for the first time and my friends were teaching me Tamil. And they asked me to interact with this silent guy seating the last bench and ask him to concentrate on the class in Tamil, so I said “Dei class kavanni” – Which essentially means Concentrate in the class you idiot! The look on his face was a scene to be recorded. And I kept wondering what did I say wrong! \r\nEven after that silly incident we are still married.

During this period I learnt lot of thing how to deal with people and their mind. In 1985 I got opportunity to join Indian Army where I served nation for 20 years. \r\n\r\n   During my service in Indian Army I did specialisation in radio operation and from there I find how important and how valuable specialisation is.\r\n\r\n   From 2007 I run my own readymade blouse shop and having own manufacturing unit at Vasai-Virar.

I did many odd jobs served tea coffee at events, sold clothes at a garment shop, sold insurance.\r\n\r\nI moved from one hostel to the other and I just couldn’t make ends meet. Financially things were bad, emotionally I was all  alone, mentally I was exhausted. I had become 41kgs and looked sick.\r\n\r\nHOW MANY OF YOU WERE SO DOWN AND DEPRESSED THAT YOU HAD NO IDEA WHAT YOU WOULD DO? HOW MANY FELT NOTHINGS WORKING. WELL THAT WAS ME?\r\n\r\nI didn’t know what to do? Out of the blue I get a call from aditya,\r\n\r\n\r\nHey lincia how are you? Accha listen there is an event where they need a emcee, its for Hamleys, a kid store where you need to entertain kids, I asked him what do I need to do? He said Lincia you need to anchor the whole event. I will pay you 2500 for 6 hours. The minute I heard 2500 for 6 hours I was really happy because that was a lot of money for me then. Though I was really scared because I didn’t know the A of Anchoring.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I walked inside the store there were bubbles all around, I saw someone blowing the bubbles and saying welcome to Hamley’s, one of the finest toy store. For me all this was magic because I was seeing this for the first time.\r\n\r\nI walked to the client, and the client asked me to start.\r\nThe minute he gave me the mic, and I had to talk I went completely blank.\r\nI was so so scared, so scared that I just coukdnt speak.\r\n\r\nI remember I went and hid behind a cupboard full of teadybears.\r\n\r\nUntill the client came up to me and said you have to perform or you will have to leave.\r\n\r\nAt that time I thought if I don’t perform right now I want be able to pay my rent, because I had no money.\r\nI just gathered myself and did whatever came to my mind. I don’t know but from somewhere I remembered the musical chair game, so I played the musical chair with the kids with all the energy and whatever I knew about the game, I just gave it my all.\r\n\r\nAnd you know what the client loved it.

(857, 221507, 4, 2, 'What is the definition of being Outrageous? Why is it important to get outside one’s comfort zone.\r\nBeing Unconventional. Being Unusual. Being Shameless.\r\n\r\nPowerful system for being Outrageous and it is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nPain: Not taking Risk\r\n\r\nWhen I started of Anchoring I used to do only mall activities, and one day I got an opportunity to host one of the country’s biggest fashion events. I made tall claims to them that I will do an awesome job. \r\n\r\nI go to the venue I see high profile designers models, I remember a model coordinator saying Anchor ke bina show nahi shuru hoga, I felt very proud of myself.\r\n\r\nThe minute I went on stage, I went completely blank. I started reading from my Q card. I was walking up and down and I said fantastic 3 to 4 times.\r\n\r\nThere was a brief sec when it crossed my mind to run away, to just run away….But I am so glad I didn’t\r\n\r\nThe organisor’s never saw my face after that. Didn’t take my calls nor my messages.\r\n\r\nSo what did i do I came up with a formula that made me take risk after risk after risk. The very same formula that led me to do 400+ shows. A few years ago the same organisor met meand loved my work. He said i had really grown confident. I had grown confident because of the powerful formula I created.\r\n\r\n2) Taking risks getting outside your comfort zone involve A LOT OF big decision making.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was in a 7 year relationship. And it was not the best of relationship. He used to physically abuse me. Give me all the bad words in the world. \r\n\r\nOnce I was traveling for my work to Pune, and a boy in the bus tried to misbehave with me. I remember I called my than boyfriend and he said you know what you deserve this. I told you to be a teacher, so you can just go to work,  live a comfortable life. You deserve this, you deserve to be treated this way.\r\n\r\nWhy was I not taking decision?\r\nHowever I was okay being treated this way at that time, because it was hard for me to make the decision to move on. I was like I have given 07 years of my life, what will I do without him.\r\n\r\nBut taking a risk, taking a decision to say no to abuses, no to making me feel like shit was the best decision of my life.\r\n\r\nBut thank god for the D theory, my life changed. I used the D theory and this guy was out of my life. There was no looking back. \r\n\r\nD theory will get you to take that decision that you have never been taking in your life.\r\n\r\nPain Point: What people think about me?\r\n\r\nHow many of you have been in a situation where you want to do something in life but you are afraid that people may judge me.\r\n\r\nI remember when I was in 9th standard, and I was someone who was very bubbly, would love connecting with people, and would greet people with smiles. However one day my mom noticed me smiling at my neighbor and said why are you smiling, people will think you are approachable. You are a challu  girl.\r\n\r\nThough I loved greeting people, I stopped smiling. I used to purposely look down when my neighbor’s were around and ignored them.\r\n\r\nThe impression I had was if I smile I would be judged as a chalu girl. (I will attract guys around me) \r\n\r\n\r\nWe let others opinion affect us.\r\n\r\nI remember few years ago I believed whatever others said. Had no opinion about myself. Someone said you can be a good teacher so I decided to do teachers training, some one said you can be an LIC agent to make money I did that too, someone said why don’t you try acting, so went ahead and joined Anupum Kher’s Actor Prepares.\r\n\r\nI never had my own opinion until Anchoring happened when I believed that this is what I wanted to do. But there were several people at that time that judged me and said you are a terrible at your job.\r\n\r\nI remember I was hosting a show for Architects, Shri Nitin Gadkari ji was also there, in the middle of the show the client calls me back stage and says your too overconfident and your doing terrible show. Honestly it was a badly run show by them, no briefing, no event flow and everything was badly managed. I remember at that I believed I was terrible and I was not meant for stage and I should quit anchoring.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo i created a powerful magical system to set me free from others opinion of me.This system has allowed me to host shows in front of 10000 people\'s of people not worrying what others think of me.\r\n\r\nHow many of you have had negative people in your life? \r\n\r\n03 years ago I had extremely negative people around me. My ex boyfriend, than the work I was attracting in my life, where I had no value, the audience I was attracting looked at women in a very sleazy way. \r\n\r\nMy friend circle was a very fake lot, sab kuch dikhava, I coudnt find genuine ness. T\r\n\r\nI used to attract the wrong people, wrong experiences and I wondered why was this happening. \r\n\r\nPain: Why am I continuously attracting the wrong people\r\nWhere do I want to be:\r\nI wanted Go getters, people who have a vision, people who are motivated in life. I wanted to be surrounded by those kind of people in my life.\r\nSo I am going to share with you 3 step system that I used in order to attract people in my life. It’s called the ABC system.\r\nA-	Attracting right friends, clients, relationships in my life. \r\nB-	Being Valuable: \r\nC-	Creating an Environment\r\n\r\nIts this very system that moved me from 2500 Rs. For 6 hours to 60k for 3 hours of talk.\r\n\r\nAnd I tried so many things in order to make myself valuable and get them in my environment.\r\nFor me to work on this, I need more time to spend with with you, I will have to work 1 on 1 with you, because it took me time to master that but I will teach you a step by step programme in my exclusive one on one programme.\r\n\r\nAre you ready to get outrageous? Are you ready to push yourself outside your comfort Zone.\r\n\r\nIt’s called my Ouch system:\r\n\r\n-	My magical blue print that I have been using in the last 04 years in more than 100’s of shows around the globe that empowers you and gives you freedom from others opinion of you.\r\n\r\nIt’s called my Ouch system to push me to do things where I don’t care what other people think.\r\n', 0),

(895, 42868, 3, 2, 'I grow up in a middle class family and when I was a kid I always enjoyed making some stuff & selling so I guess I always wanted to be an entrepreneur. During the last year of my college due to family responsibilities I decided to take up a job. I started working at a very early age. While I was working I also did my Masters Degree started working  in the HR function in an IT company. I always had a passion to guide and support people. So this really worked for me very well. I love working with people, understanding the, knowing them and help them and transforming them is something I enjoy from the core of my heart. I feel happy seeing people achieve their goals. This lead me to very good position in my career during my corporate stint. I was responsible for a large business unit closely working with Business Heads understanding their challenges and helping them work through it, coaching and supporting them was a fabulous thing. However being responsible for a large BU was not a 9 to 6 job. I quit when my second daughter was born & this gave me an opportunity to pursue my entrepreneurial dream. I started coaching people which gave me flexibility to operate. One day a colleague of mine who had just started their business called me for help and they were stuck in some thought process. I happened to coach them through it successfully which had a great impact on the business. This is the time I realised that this is the set of people I can coach. I tagged myself as a Business Coach and started coaching business owners. I definitely know that I have the ability to understand the problems business owners /leaders face & I can coach them successfully . Since then I have successfully coached several business owners & they have seen a remarkable growth in their business. That’s the reason I fell I have ETR to do business coaching\r\n', 0),

Papa had been working in L&T since 1980, and had been living in Bangalore since 1978. Till 2004, he had been struggling with his job, in the sense he really loved what he was doing, but was struggling money wise. Technically he was brilliant- he had played pivotal roles in many large projects- if you have seen the Indian Army bridge launcher system, that was designed by my dad. He has also designed extremely large Hydraulic Sugar crushers. All the while he was not making too much money. In 2004 he got an opportunity to go to Indore as the Manufacturing head of the Pitampur plant. At that time I was doing Engineering, just about to graduate and get a job myself. In- spite of being at this crucial juncture, my decided to move to Indore with my mom- I would continue to stay on in Bangalore. As a dad, it is something very difficult to do, because he wanted to be able to guide me in the initial days of my career. Moving to Indore proved to be one of the best things to have happened to our family. He retired from the board of directors, after taking charge as the CEO and Head of New Product Development. Imagine what would have happened if he hadn’t been able to muster up the courage to make the move.\r\nHow Baba’s life turned around- Baba had been working in the textile field in Mumbai for quite some time. Just as his career was about to take off, the textile mills in Mumbai began to shut down. Since he was a valued employee, only he and four others were selected to be given an opportunity. This was a shit opportunity at best. He would have to move to Gujarat, and at half the pay, while working twice as hard. Yes, the move was a necessity, but it also required a lot of courage- to leave behind his wife and three children still going to school. That move turned around the life of everyone in the family. He has fought back with courage and determination, and today heads an entire textile company, with about 60,000 employees. If he had decided to switch to another simpler job, like a typist or a clerk, which he very well could have, then his family would not have seen the level of prosperity that they are seeing today.\r\nHow Kash turned her life around- Kash is a very dear close friend. She was a happy- go lucky, cheerful and bubbly girl. Until her brother died at the age of 34 in 2005. He was 34, newly married and with a lovely wife and two adorable kids. The same year, another person she was close to-her Grandmother also died. Kash spent the next few years oscillating between denial, depression and anger. She went from overweight to obese. The day her life turned around was the day she decided to start working out everyday, no matter what. Putting her life and soul into her workouts helped channelise her inner heavings. Then she began to eat right. The she began to focus on her work. She made a decision to face her challenges head on, she chose to be the absolute best at working out, eating right and being the best at her work. Today she is a healthy weight, happy and loves to travel. She heads the APAC region for her company, and for her the sky is the limit.\r\nDay 2 (contd.): Use the wheel of life tool. Teach the participant how to use it for their current situation, and how they can apply it in future situations as well.\r\n\r\nAssignment 1 to be given during the teleconference till Day 11: Write down a description of yourself 50 years from now. Be as detailed as possible. Recommend to the participant to write a little everyday, so by the end of 10 days, they have a story booklet that will be there with them for life. (The outcome is to be aware of the current situation they are in and to know where they have to reach in the future)\r\n\r\nAssignment 1 to be given during the teleconference till day 22: Apply the wheel of life tool and identify the areas you want to work on. Encourage them to re- apply it on the area they identify in round 1. Go as micro as possible. Give them the message that this is an awesome tool they can use in any part of their life. Each time they use this tool, they will have to record the results (The outcome is to get clarity on their current situation, and the the areas they want to work on)\r\n\r\nDay 3 to Day 11: Time given to participants to complete assignment 1\r\nDay 11 to Day 22: Time given to participants to complete assignment 2\r\n\r\nDay 22- receive the assignments\r\nDay 22 to day 25- review the assignments and give feedback.\r\n\r\nDay 22: Mastermind meet\r\n\r\nAgenda of the meet: \r\n\r\nTotal duration: 120 minutes\r\n15 minutes- stories of transformations <find out more stories>\r\n30 minutes- Overview of the topics covered:\r\nWheel of life- and how to apply it, how to apply it on second level, third level etc.\r\nWrite down a description of yourself\r\nPain- pleasure equation\r\nWhat assignments 1 through 2 were, and what were the expected outcomes.\r\n60 minutes- Sharing by the participants- Interventions if necessary- on the spot coaching if necessary\r\n15 minutes- Questions\r\n\r\n\r\nThe outcome of step 1 is to be aware that a transformation is needed.

If any participant volunteers with his input, I will use that as an example to make the concept clear. If no one volunteers, I will take the story of a celebrity and apply it to the equation. The outcome of this data point is to give clarity to the participant on how they are operating, and what would happen of they changed it (applied to whatever has emerged as the outcome from step 1)\r\nCelebrity story- Initiate a discussion by taking the example of alcoholism and drug abuse in Bollywood. Ask the participants how they would apply this to the pain- pleasure equation. (The outcome is to reinforce the Pain- Pleasure learning and the cause- effect learning)\r\nContinue- Ask the participants to pick up a decision they took. Apply the same equations. (The outcome is to reinforce the Pain- Pleasure learning)\r\n\r\nAssignment 3 to be given during the teleconference till day 33: Write your own story (from your perspective). Apply the Cause- effect equation. Analyse whether you were in cause or effect. What would it be like if you had been in the other state? Use the format Before- Now. Again, ask the participant to be as detailed as possible, write a little every day. (Outcome is to be clear about what is the participant\'s current motivation, and what happens if he changes it)\r\n\r\nAssignment 4 to be given during the teleconference till day 44: Use the wheel of life again- list out what the participant wants- put it on the wheel of life- find out what’s most important/ if the participant can handle it, find out what the top three things that he wants are. (Outcome is to get clear on what the participant wants to achieve)\r\n\r\nDay 22 to Day 33: Time given to participants to complete assignment 3\r\nDay 33 to Day 44: Time given to participants to complete assignment 4\r\n\r\nDay 44- receive the assignments\r\nDay 44 to day 47- review the assignments and give feedback\r\n\r\nStep 3- What do I need to do and how do it do it- Step title EUREKA (Signifies the Eureka moment when there is a clear path)\r\n\r\nDay 44 to day 66 -> Assignment 5, Assignment 6, Mastermind meet\r\n\r\nDay 44- Mastermind meet\r\n\r\nAgenda of the meet: \r\n\r\nTotal duration: 120 minutes\r\n15 minutes- stories of transformations <find out more stories>\r\n30 minutes- Overview of the topics covered:\r\nWheel of life- and how to apply it, how to apply it on second level, third level etc.\r\nWrite down a description of yourself\r\nPain- pleasure equation\r\nWhat assignments 1 through 4 were, and what were the expected outcomes.\r\n60 minutes- Sharing by the participants- Interventions if necessary- on the spot coaching if necessary\r\n15 minutes- Questions\r\n\r\nAssignment 5 to be given out during the mastermind meet till day 55: \r\nHandout to be given: Outcome generator -> What do I want?

I had very high dreams and aspirations to do many things in my life after passing out from a prestigious Institute, Indian Institute of Technology in India.  With lot of hard work and immense determination I had secured seat to do my post-graduation in this Institute, which is one of the top institutes in India.  The company which I had hired me wanted to send me to California for long assignment in the next one month.  I was hand-picked by this company for this work was as IITians are more popular because of their intelligence. I was so jubilant with full of high spirit to leave for US in next one month. All my family members were also quite happy about this news.  It is not so easy to go and work in USA without studying in one of those universities there.  In India for any educated and intelligent person it would be a dream to secure a job in US. I had securities admission by cracking one of the toughest exams and was even granted scholarship by the government of India throughout my course.\r\n\r\nOne fateful day on Nov 13, 1994 I had a fall from the fourth floor. May be because I was having very high fever, as per the doctors I would have walked to the balcony in delirium (state of mental disturbance due to high fever). My right hand was broken into three places and back was broken. I was covered with plaster of paris all over the body and bandage. Injury was so severe I had spent lot of time in the hospital. After I met with an accident my life was fully confined to hospital lying on the bed motionless for quite some time.  Approximately after 3-4 months one day doctor comes to me and says “ Niranjan,  you have to get out of the bed and get used to  wheelchair  from here onwards.  You are not going to walk in your lifetime”. Hearing this news was a biggest shock of my life at this time. I just could not say anything, all that was happening in my mind that moment was a complete silence.  Slowly tears started coming from eyes. My entire life was in a rock bottom stage from the life of a person who had so high dreams  to achieve so many things in the life. I was not able to think anything about my life and my head was totally blank for few days. I had not even dreamt such a thing would happen to me. I was totally dejected, depressed and devastated in my life during those days.  The daytime somehow was getting passed smoothly as I used to spend my time talking to doctors , nurses, my relatives and other visitors who came to see me. But night time was pretty difficult to spend in  dark. Most of the time I was looking   the roof of the room in which I was staying   throughout night.  I never used to get sleep till early morning as my life was in such a dismal state.  Entire world was looking so dark with no hope. I could not think much except  worrying about what would happen to me in future. I was not able to accept my life imagining my future life going to be spent on the wheelchair forever. I was feeling frustrated to accept this physical disability of mine. I would wonder why such a thing had to happen to me only.  When I looked back, I had not committed any grave mistake or  injury to anyone in my life. My life was completely stopped.   At times I used to curse even God, Almighty or Superpower (which we call as per our belief) for having put me in this horrible situation and even ask “ Why me?”.\r\n \r\nLeft with no hope about what to do in future, I was gradually getting frustrated and depressed day by day. Finally one day I even decided to end my life. I decided to commit suicide by  hanging my myself to the fan, in the hospital room. This was not becoming possible as I could not get up on the bed due to my disability.  When this was not possible, I started thinking to drink pesticides. Even this was not possible, as someone had to bring pesticides for me from the shop.  Like this every day I started to think different techniques to die. When all the techniques failed, after one month I decided, there must be some purpose from the God for me for this incident to happen in my life at this point of time. From that day onwards slowly I started accepting the reality  and my physical disabled body. This was not so easy as I had to compromise with so many things in my thinking  to lead my future life in the wheelchair. I started thinking what next?. There were only two choices either to give up or keep going  in the  life.  I chose not to give up and get going. I told myself “ my right hand and legs may not be functioning as usual but I have my brain which is intact “, so  why can\'t I use my intelligence for my living. I was stuck with worries, fear of future life and so many limitations in the mind apart from the physical limitations. \r\n\r\n\r\nStory 2: \r\n\r\nAbout Nick’s story:\r\n\r\nNick Vijucic is a man born without Limbs (arms  and legs).  He is a great example for the entire world ,  as how one can reinvent  one\'s life.  I was reading his book “ Life without limits” Written by him.  He was discarded by his own mother who refused to see him when he was born hearing from a doctor who was so much hesitating to say he is born with no arms and legs to his mother when she  insisted him to show newborn Nick.  It is a rare medical condition where babies are born with missing limbs as per doctors.  She refused to hold baby Nick  when nurses who had brought, to show newborn  Nick to his mother. Instead of celebrating his birthday the whole family and church mourned “ Why did Almighty  Our God, let something like this to happen to this family.  What wrong his parents had done in their life. My physical disability was not  as   worse as Nick’s disability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStory 3: \r\nMr. Boniface Prabhu,  Who is one of my close friends  with whom I have a great friendship since Year 2000. He became quadriplegic due to illness caused when he was a small boy at the age of four , He is  a wheelchair tennis player and one of the pioneers of wheelchair sport in India. He was awarded Padma Shree  the  fourth  civilian  award by the government of India in the year 2014. Why don\'t we imagine the situation to his parents and Bony at that time. This person went on to become one of the great champion which the world has seen.\r\n\r\nWe all have choices to make either to give up or keep going. I have a choice; you have a choice.  We can choose to keep thinking about these disappointments and shortcomings. what is the effect we have,  we become angry, bitter ,sad when faced with hard  times or  any situation . We have to learn from our experiences keep moving forward by taking the responsibility for our    own life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStory 4: My professional Life\r\n\r\nOutcome: \r\nThe next break through which I caused  in my life was overcoming professional challenges despite having physical limitations and being on   wheelchair. Only when we go beyond our negative self-talks, fear and anxiety we can take better decisions in the life.\r\n\r\nBefore starting my job, I had spent 2 years in the hospital which was quite difficult not only for me for anyone spend such a long time without any hope and doing anything.  When I was in the hospital, I was operated almost  16 to 17 times and taken to  operation theatre for the operation  for various reasons.  Repairing my right hand took lot of time as it had broken into 3 pieces when tragedy struck me.  During my stay in the hospital I would have taken approximately 3000 + injections for my   ailment.  During the occupational therapy I was made to walk using calipers and crutch. Walking using these aids was not possible as I had problem of holding the grip over the crutch using my right hand. Finally I decided to use wheelchair permanently, as I was worried that I might fall if I use crutches.  Finally with exhaustive stay in hospital secured job  in an IT Company.  When I went to interview ,  HR manager did not want to interview me for my capabilities as I had passed from IIT.  All that he wanted was  whether, I would be comfortable to sit for 8 hours every day on the  wheelchair at work. I was given a job of contractor  for six months which was a temporary job as they were unsure about my health conditions.\r\n\r\nAfter I got a job as a contractor for six months, one day our HR manager came to me and asked enquired  me, whether I could write a software application for his department. They told me that they would give one intern for me help. I was told that I would going to be  a Project leader to execute this project. It was a testing time for me to prove myself . So I decided to accept this challenge as an opportunity.  Within short time and well before the deadline I was able to get software application done for HR department.  The management was happy and  recognizing my competence, I was absorbed as a permanent employee in the same organization. So  when an opportunity comes one should take decision as quickly as possible without any hesitation or negative mindset. \r\n\r\n\r\nStory 5: (Modifying my car)\r\n\r\nOutcome: \r\nI brought transformation in my daily life, by switching over travelling in an auto  rickshaw every day to customize my own hand driven car. My life became more independent with reduced dependency on others. Outcome I got from this incident is , from that day onwards I became more independent  to live with more freedom and reducing the dependency on others.  If we have will to go beyond our limitations there will be some way or other to create life of our own.\r\n\r\nI used to commute daily in an auto when I started my job in 1997. It was very difficult to get inside the auto as I had to take the help of auto driver also on more person every day to help me and make me to sit inside the auto and get out of the auto to make me to sit on the wheel chair when I reached my office and also near my home. I had hired one caregiver boy of 19 years to help me at home and  whenever I had to go outside.  His name is Kabayappa. Everyday this person used to  accompany me  to the office and back home. He used to stay in the office during office hours for any support such as going to washroom  or any other work where I needed some external help. Washrooms  in India  were not user friendly for physically challenged people in the building where our office was located and always I needed some sort of external help to manage. At times the auto driver without any notice was missing without any intimation. So in such situation either I had to depend on other auto or miss going to office.  So this was impacting my performance in the job as those days most of the work used to happen at the workplace, unlike the present situation where people can work from home and still be productive. This dependence on him was becoming difficult challenge to handle. \r\n\r\n One day my organization(Philips Software Centre) in the year 2000 in which I was working sponsored me the hand controlled car which was customized for my disability as a   recognition reward for extraordinary performance for helping my organization to get a prestigious International  Quality certification. When I ordered the new car and it was modified in the dealers place ,I was called  for a trial to drive and give my feedback about the customization of hand controls.  I did not know how to drive at all and had not driven any car till such time.  I was made to set in the driver\'s seat,   somehow manage to drive for one or two kilometers and not more than this distance.  The next challenge for me was to take the car to my home on the day it was completely ready.  I had taken a driver along with me to help me to bring the car to my home and later wanted to practice near my home  for few days.  I was highly scared to drive the car in the middle of the traffic and in the city, till I get sufficient confidence through practicing  near my home.  But my thinking was wrong as the Works manager wanted me to take the car myself driving from the dealers place to my home.  He even told me that this the only way to get out of the fear of driving middle of the traffic for which I was refusing to accept his suggestion.  He even told me my driver who had come along with me, in case something goes wrong to pull  handbrake. He even suggested the driver who had come with me to sit  beside me in the next seat.  The Bangalore city even  in those days had high traffic. Though  I had lot of fear to drive as I did not even drive at any point of time in my life, I still took a decision to go  beyond my fear to drive the car from dealer’s place to my home in the middle of the traffic. Finally I drove the car without any  accident to my home.  This gave me a tremendous confidence to handle more tough challenges in life.\r\n\r\nMy life has been transformed from  that day as I have become so much independent today without depending on anyone in case I have to go outside or visit some sightseeing places. I have driven  myself alone for many sightseeing places along with my son who was quite  young in those days.  I have driven at a stretch of 600 km sometimes.  This experience of driving car  has given me  so much confidence to accept more and more challenges in my life, with positive mindset and go beyond my fears. If we have to live our life the way we want we have to take risk and accept the challenges without too much worrying about the fear and negative self-talks going on  in our mind.  All it requires is changing the state of our mind from negative mindset to the positive mindset. I learnt how to go beyond challenges in spite of my physical limitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEP 2: CLEAN SLATE\r\n(The past has no power on us)\r\n\r\nSTORY 6: \r\nOne more major breakthrough   in my life was becoming a family man despite my physical challenge. If one except any happenings in the life positively the life will open up for multiple possibilities and anything can be possible in the life.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in the hospital in the year 1995,   I was affected with the bed sore infecting  my buttock very badly.  The main reason for this condition was due to my immobility for a long time and staying on the bed most of the time.  There was a lot of muscle loss and it was not getting healed. Plastic Surgeon who was attending decided to perform surgery which is called rotational flap (in medical terms) to stitch the wound, but they were not able to resume surgery due to the infection.  Hence they decided first clear the infection and keep the wound fresh  to perform surgery. So there was a necessity of dressing it every day  remove the infection to prepare the world for surgery.\r\n\r\n At this time  one day a Nurse  who was a nursing student studying final year was appointed to take care of dressing of the wound.  She came like an angel in my life at this  time.  She was also looking very beautiful. Her responsibility assigned for me was everyday she had to come and give a dressing of the wound to me. I was staying in a separate room in the hospital and there were no other patients in this room.  As the dressing of wound used  take quite some time due to the large size of the wound,  she used to converse with me and chat with me while dressing was being done.  Slowly these meetings made us to become good friends  within few days.  Later this friendship became deeper  and we started loving each other. She had lot of concern for me. She used to like me as I was educated and intelligent in spite of me coming  from  middle class family. She had lot  of sympathy for me. I had no parents alive except my brothers and sisters. All of them had their family  and their  own responsibilities. This great woman  who later became my girlfriend and always stood by me.  She wanted to live with me and take care of me, looking at my helplessness condition. Her entry into my life  was a big miracle.  She was a big support for  me apart for providing love and care.  I had to depend on her  for even for small things.  My bed sore  was completely cured after the surgery.  She played a big role in the process of curing as she had to do dressing with lot of care  daily.  We both came to Bangalore after getting discharged from the hospital in Oct 1996. She also accompanied me to Mumbai during last two months of rehabilitation. Finally, I got a job and started working in 1997.  We both used to live together In a separate  two bedroom house.  We  also got married  in 1998.  My life was so beautiful as we both were spending  very good time  together. I had never dreamt such a thing would happen in my life, as I had my own negative self-talk which I had imposed on myself that no one would ever come to marry a physically challenged person.  This was just my own limitations which was self-imposed by myself on my life. This woman  loved me even when I was a patient in the hospital.  I even  discouraged her, for her decision to live with a physically challenged person in future. But she did not change her  decision at all to love me.\r\nOne more miraculous incident  happened in my life. This is the entry of a third person to our family. I and my wife  adopted a boy  in the year 2000. He was 9 months old when he came to our house.   The main reason for deciding to  go for adoption was,  I was not able to become a biological father due to my physical disability.  We named him as Pranav.  There was even a small documentary film which was  made on three of us and  was telecasted  in a TV about our decision of adoption,  praising  both of us for the positive attitude we had shown  towards orphan child,  as many would not come forward to adopt a child in those days.  The message to the society, which was being conveyed in this documentary film was , “  Why parents  who do not have children  are not coming forward  for adoption when  parents with a physically challenged father could think of adoption” and  giving a life to orphan kid. \r\n\r\n\r\nStory 7:\r\nThe Outcome:\r\nSeparation from my wife and how I overcame the trauma by forgiving her forever. Forgiving people who have come in our life is the best way to live the life with happiness and peace. When we are not forgiving people, actually it affects as rather than the person who came in our life.\r\n\r\nMy life with Sheela (name changed for privacy) along with our adopted son Pranav was going pretty well. The whole world was looking very beautiful to me.  I had become a complete family person like any other normal  able body people. I never  had dreamt such a thing would happen in my life.  One miracle was a woman coming forward to marry me and another miracle was an entry of  Pranav  in my life.  It was  like a Cinderella becoming a queen in the story of Cinderella. Miracle after  miracle  was happened in my life in a very short time.  Sheela used to take care of   Pranav with lot of love and care.  I hardly bothered about myself and Pranav as we both were  being taken care by Sheela quite well.  She was executing all her responsibilities of the house looking after both of us( Myself and Pranav)  without much of a problem.   All three of us used to go for a shopping together or for any outing. We also had hired a  girl of  15 years to take care of Pranav to support my wife. This girl used to come every day at my 9 am and used to live at 5 p.m, was helping Sheela  in the household work and  also taking care of  Pranav.   There was nothing missing in my life as I was completely satisfied in personal and also professional life. At the job also things were going great , as within short time I was heading a group of 10 people from nowhere. But life is always one roller and coaster ride,  there will be ups and down in the life. This  happened to my life also. \r\n\r\nIn the year  2002,  my wife Sheela  came to me and expressed  that  she wanted to have a different life,  wanted to get separated from me.   This was an unexpected, unanticipated biggest shock of my life.  This was such a worst news for me,  not even at my tragedy had  caused me so much pain me and  so much  disappointment when I heard this from Sheela. I never had smallest hint  about her inclination to get separated as things were going quite well  in our life and no serious problems between us both. I tried lot convince her to live together.  I even took the help of some of my close family friends to make her to change the mind. But nothing fruitful  outcome came through these negotiations.  Ultimately we both decided to get separated and got mutually divorced legally in a court family court within one year.  She  left us (Me and Pranav) in January 2002. When I looked back,  there were no serious disagreements, quarrels between both of us.  What to do?  When my  life partner was not interested to live together there was no  point in  continuing our relations  further.  I did not want to leave my son to go away from my life.   Hence I and Sheela wanted to take suggestion from the orphanage from we had adopted our Pranav,  to meet the head of the orphanage in Bangalore.  The head of the Orphanage was an  elderly woman  of 60 plus age. She tried  to convince my wife but she also failed to make  Sheela to change her decision.  The head of the Orphanage then suggested me to handover my two and half year son Pranav to them back , if I wanted.   She wanted to get   adopted again to another parents.  But I refused give  him back to the orphanage. \r\n\r\nI had two persons coming into my life who were like two eyes for me.  I thought “what if one eyes  was not there I had another  eye  with me”  I could still make my life wonderful.  He was the source hope for my future, which would have made even miserable , if he had not  come to our family. After Sheela left us,  Pranav became big source of hope for my future. It was a tough task to bring him up because of two reasons. One reason was , I was a physically challenged person which was very difficult to take care of him completely.  Another reason was,  there was no support of a lovely mother for him. It was very painful imagining a future  life with one more biggest challenge to bring up child of two and half years. I prayed God to give me more and more courage and stronger will power at this moment. Then  next day  without wasting my time in disappointment and losing courage, I hired a  female nurse as a caregiver for me by contacting one of the nursing services company in Kerala state. We had hired a girl around 15 years used to come to take care of Pranav at home,  when my wife was with us.  I continued with  the same girl by requesting her to stay from morning till evening to take care of Pranav.  This girl used to take him every day to a nearby play home and bring back him to my house and stay till   with him along with the Nurse till 6 p.m. in the evening.  The job of the nurse was  to take care of me and to provide little support to Pranav  at night. I used to come back in the evening from the job around 7 p.m. everyday.  This became my routine every day. \r\n\r\nLife was  becoming  quite difficult, to manage with the caregiver who was a female  around 55 years old.  Though she was good at her job of taking care of me but was unable to provide physical  help as she was feeling too old to support me. Hence due to  this reason within one month I had to ask for a replacement for another female nurse who was younger in age compared to the earlier nurse who came to take care, thinking that this would solve my problem. This person within few days looking at my lifestyle as I had nice house, car and good job in an Multinational company, might have become greedy. So she started taking advantage of my  disability and started asking all sorts of favors. At times she  refused to come and help me. It was becoming  difficult  to manage my life with help of this nurse  too.  Again I had to ask for another replacement for a female nurse. There after one more female nurse came to help me. Even this female also had some ulterior motive after seeing my lifestyle, job and income.  She also started taking advantage of my physical helplessness ,when I refused to yield to her desires.  \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Myself and Pranav  moved to  my own  new apartment,  which I had booked when Sheela was with us. Again I had to ask for a replacement,  this time for a male nurse.  I wanted to avoid female nurses for various reasons.  This time, I had hired a female cook who used to come and cook for us two times in a day. I had a sigh of relief and thought this arrangement would work.  But even this replacement also did not help me much as  this male nurse used to smoke in the house lot, which was  becoming a nuisance to me and my  two and half year son. Within one year I had to ask for 4 replacements and struggled lot to manage myself and my small kid. But I did not give up.  Every time life was throwing up a challenge to me to make me more and more tougher, courageous to face any events in my life.  If I had given up, not only me even my two and half year son would have been in a disastrous situation.  Hence always I said to myself “come what may I will not give up, situations cannot deter my courage”.  Finally, I  found one elderly woman from my native place who was a widow around 50 plus age. After this lady came to your house in the year 2003 lot of things changed.  She was quite good and take care of both of us very nicely.  She never  showed any ulterior motive. She  used to take good care of Pranav at home.  I had found a daycare home for him.  Every day in the morning I used to take him along with me in  my car live him at the daycare  and picking him  up in the evening while coming back from my office.  So this arrangement started working quite positively  for both of us. This lady is still with us even today and it has been over 16 years now, since she came to our house.  She has brought up Pranav from the age of three years.  Now he is 19 years old youth. \r\n\r\n\r\n'),

(204, 225501, 2, '2', 'Story 8: ( My trip to Switzerland)\r\n\r\nOutcome:\r\nAnother breakthrough in my profession was visiting Switzerland during my official duty in Netherlands in the year 2004. The great learning I got was, “how one can go your beyond all limitations to realize the dream”. One has to get out of comfort zone to get if we have to get something which we want.  The  risk taking ability  of a person decides how adventurous one can be in  dealing with all the challenges in the life.\r\n\r\nThings were going quite well in my job,  the people in my organization had lot of good understanding  with me.  Some of my colleagues  including my boss knew  what was happening in my personal life including my separation  and how I came out of this  situation.  So they had lot of sympathy for my personal life,   most of them  where very friendly with me and was treating me with lot of respect as I was managing  my life with my son Pranav with the help of caregivers alone. My separation incident impacted me for some time in my job as I was mentally down for some time. But  I never gave up and bounced back very strongly to keep my performance in the job to be as good as others.  I  maintained good performance  in the job, despite  the  internal suffering I was undergoing within me.  But I never showed  it on others.  Every day I was becoming more and more mentally tough at the job as well as handling  my personal matters at the home.  I never wanted Pranav to   have any problem at any point of time.  I always keep himself happy as much as possible.\r\n\r\nThere was a situation for which I had to go on official duty to Netherlands which was my headquarters of my organization.  I wanted to visit Switzerland , which is one of the tourist place. It was one of my dreams to visit this place one day.  But imagining going to Switzerland alone was not all that easy task without taking  anyone with me to assist me throughout my trip to Netherlands,  Switzerland and coming back to India.  One of my family friend’s  couple was  living in Switzerland, this was the only support I had. In order to undertake this journey I had to change  flight  at Zurich and take another flight to Amsterdam.  Though  I had my own internal doubts and fears, still  I took the risk of travelling alone by air.  One of the big challenge for me is,   I do not have control over my bladder and   bowel.  If I drink more water in the flight my bladder might become full and   going to that toilets in the aircraft to empty my bladder was not possible.  I can’t get up from my seat and sit on the  wheelchair . Always I needed some  assistance from someone in the aircraft to physically lift me and making me to sit on the  wheelchair.  Airlines normally do not provide any assistance to a physically challenged person in the aircraft to go to toilet, if the person is unable to get up  himself to sit on the  wheelchair.  I also don\'t have good control over my bowel,  and managing both is not all that easy throughout the journey. I had to drink very less water and consume less food during my entire journey. But still undertook this journey to fulfill my dream to visit Switzerland. I planned the entire trip in such a way that I will go  to Netherlands  via  Zurich  during both onward and return journey.  I had planned  to visit Switzerland by breaking my journey during the return journey from Netherlands to India at Zurich and take return flight at Zurich back to India, after I finish seeing Switzerland.  I travelled entire flight journey  bye managing  in the flight by consuming less water and food,  without going to the toilet, except   using the washroom at Zurich airport. With the help of my family friend and his wife I visited the highest Alps in the Switzerland which is called Titlis Alps. I was  top of the  mountain Alps at the Height of 3200 meters.   It was a great achievement which was thought to be impossible for me.  Everything was there only in the mind , Fear and anxiety never deterred  me at all to undertake this kind of  journey.  Whatever limitation are in the mind are not real. There was a big shift in my mind after I returned to India.\r\n\r\nStory 9: My life with my son\r\n\r\nOutcome:\r\nLife can be made wonderful and it is a special creation of God.  Each of us have the right to enjoy and live to the fullest.  Our happiness should not depend on any external objects.  It is in your hands to create the life to be wonderful for yourself. I and my son has been living a  wonderful life even today, despite all types of challenges I have at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBringing up my son Pranav at the age of three years with the help of caregivers has been quite challenging and an uphill task.  I had to  give attention to all minor aspects of Pranav apart from taking care of myself.  My caregiver is not very educated person,  and I only shoulder all the responsibilities of running the house,  ordering groceries from a departmental stores,  ordering Gas Agency to bring out bring the gas cylinder,  going for shopping to get clothes to myself and Pranav.  All the responsibilities of managing my three year old son and  the family  came on me  after Sheela’s  departure.\r\n\r\nMy caregiver is  such a great woman , even though when some people offered more salary to her to quit the job,  she refused to accept the request  thinking about helplessness of my situation.  She could have become greedy for more salary and  left us.  She did not get attract to any such greed and has been staying with me till today purely on the humanitarian ground to provide support for us.  We are like a one family today,  though we  all have  come from different background. This is something which  makes me to think  that,  it is in our hands to  create  the beauty in the life, happiness in our family.  It is not necessary  that to give happiness  to the children, both parents have to be living together.  As a single parent being a physically  challenged  person, I have been able to take care of my son from his childhood. Why can\'t this be a lesson  for those  who struggle to have happiness and worrying about their spouses when they are not there in their life?. Myself and Pranav have visited tourist places like Ooty ,  Munnar,  Kodaikanal,  Pondicherry,  Goa,  Hyderabad  and other regional  tourist places nearby Bangalore  together by driving down  my hand driven car to all these places. Today he is the best companion for me.  We need each other to create great life for   each of us. \r\n\r\nI had to teach him driving  my hand driven car when he was 10 years old kid. This was  done not  due to some craziness, but out of necessity.  Whenever  we both used to go together in a car and park it nearby shop, one or the other  people used to park the car next to my car.  So this was becoming so inconvenient for me to take out my car as there was no dedicated parking space for physically challenged people in most of the cities in India.  This was the same situation even in Bangalore.  I couldn’t sit in my driver seat, as other cars were parked beside my car. In case I have to take the car out, either I had to call the owner of the car or wait till the person next to my car comes back and takes it out. In order to overcome this limitation I found a way  to teach Pranav to drive my car in this type emergence so that we both don\'t wait for someone to take their car out of parking space.  When I  taught Pranav how to drive the car, life became much easy whenever we both used to go outside. This kind of problems physically  challenged people do not face in foreign  countries,  due to strict rule there regulated by the governments of those countries  to have a dedicated  parking place for physically challenged people.  This action of mine transformed my life as I need not depend on others now. Now he is 19 years old and we both drive car by sharing each other when we go  for long trips outside my Bangalore for visit.\r\n\r\nTo quote on more incident  which happened in July 2018,  I had to attend a 5 day course in Goa travelling alone by air , which normally I do when whenever  I go out Bangalore for my official work.  Air ticket was booked for me for onward and  return journey   three to four weeks in advance.  Just before one week of my departure , I had a minor health issue. Hence , I was about to postpone my trip.  But training was very important for my future career. When I consulted a doctor,  he  advised me to take someone along with me  to provide a personal attention in the room at night.   When doctor said like this, the next thought that came to my mind was my son’s name. I  decided  he is the best guy to accompany me.  But  wanted  to take my power wheelchair along with me, for easy mobility during the course.  This Wheel chair  is quite heavy and cannot be easily transported in the aircraft. Hence I decided to take my car so that I can keep this wheelchair in the back side of the car.  The distance from Bangalore to Goa is around 600 km,  which is not so easy to drive alone for a person like me.  As my son Pranav was there with me we  drove to Goa at a stretch  of 12 hours nonstop,  by sharing each other.  Same  was the situation during the return journey also.  Many times in our life people give up when  things  seem impossible, thinking the difficulty of the situation.  But it is always in our hands to go beyond these kind of difficult situations provided we  have a willingness and strong determination. \r\n\r\nIf I feel like going to movie, we go together. My son helps me to keep  the power wheelchair in my car both at home and near the film theater. We both enjoy   the  movie and come back home.  If I had to go for shopping , again we go together  do shopping , roam inside the shopping mall  and come back home.  We both enjoy our life to the fullest  without worrying too much about what is not there with us.  We both intend to do many more things together to have a great life.  One of my dreams is, take him together and travel  all over the world . This will  happen one day in our life.  My son Pranav  is wonderful gift for me from the God.  I am so thankful to my ex-wife,  Sheela today. Probably I would not have got him from the orphanage had I been a single parent.  Because she was with me, the orphanage  people  didn\'t have much hesitation to handover  a 9 month child to us at that time of adoption.  I do not have any resentment today as she is not with us,  I have completely forgiven her forever. As long as she was with me in my life,  she  did play her role in an excellent manner by bringing me to the mainstream of life.\r\n\r\n'),

Later I started my own Consulting company to start my entrepreneur life. The outcome of this experience is that we need to follow our heart live the life we want. Do what you  are good at and what you love,  because this will give lot of satisfaction and fulfillment. Doing things what we do not like and love, creates dullness and monotony in the life.  Live life to the fullest by changing the focus in things based on what your inner voice says. \r\n\r\nLife  in last multinational company was going smoothly.  I used to go daily in my car and stay in office from 9 A.M to 6 p.m. this  was my  routine  since I started working in multinational companies after my accident.  This was becoming quite dull and  monotonous as, I was not able to do what I want to do in the job. Sometimes the job was too boring and I was asked to do some trivial tasks  like filling Excel sheets etc.  Somewhere in my heart, I  always used to feel that I am not really getting any enjoyment.  I had lot of love for teaching, likes to talk to people and explain them  from what is given in the book or based on my experience.  In fact after my graduation in Engineering before I proceeded to IIT for my post-graduation in 1989, I had taken a lecturer job in the same college . I had become very popular in short time as a good teacher in my college.  Students from other classes wanted to attend the class to listen my lecturing.  As it was not allowed as a rule to bunk and attend other lecturer’s class, the students from other sections wanted me to take a separate tuition in the evening after the college hours.  Such was my popularity as a lecturer.  MNC work culture is like one rat race. Everyone wants to be  successful and has to be rat  in this race, if one wants to  get promotion ,salary hike etc. Sometimes I was doing some silly things just to impress my Boss for which I was not liking.  Everyday my main intention of going to the job was to get regular salary and save my job as much as possible. Hence with lot of thinking , I decided to take up training as a freelance work  as I was good at training and resigned my organization. \r\n\r\nSo my entrepreneur life as a  Freelance Trainer started from August 2009 onwards.  Initially, I started conducting public workshops , to get myself known in the industry.  Within 6 months, I could establish myself . I started earning more than what I used to earn in an multinational companies with that kind of stiff competition among our friends group.  Since then I have never looked back  of going back and working in this type of jobs.  I work maximum for five to seven days in a month which is more than sufficient to take care of my family needs and also save  for my retirement.  Also in the year 2010, I started my own organization to have better identity of my own.  I had travel to USA two times once to Dubai to conduct my technical workshops to the clients.  I have  travelled  to conduct workshops within India such as Hyderabad, Chennai, Mumbai, Bhubaneswar, Kolkata , Cochin ,Trivandrum and Delhi.  I always travel by air alone  on the  wheelchair. Every time when I travel from my hometown to the cities listed above, I travel alone by taking the support of airlines staff and taxi drivers during my journey.  These people help me at the departure and arrival.  As far as possible if the city has rooms designed especially for physically challenged people, I normally book these hotels in the cities.  But it is not mandatory that I cannot stay in other type of rooms if the hotel or service apartments if they do not have user friendly access to the physically challenged people. I always take the support of the people who manage these  during my stay to get any help. Good number of people are surprised the way I manage alone by taking the support from people wherever it is necessary.  Usually my workshops will last for two to three days maximum and next day I will be back home.  I have adopted my life quite well as a self-employed in spite of  these places in some situations are not user friendly for wheelchair users. But at the end of the day I have lot of satisfaction as I am doing what I love.\r\n\r\nStory 11:\r\nOnce in the year 2013 I had to travel to USA to conduct workshop in Austin City, Texas state. The  flight journey to the US will  normally takes 24 hours.  One of my challenge for me is that, as I do not  have control of bowel and bladder  I have  to consume less water and food during the journey.  I can\'t use toilets inside aircraft due to my inability to get up and sit on the wheel chairs.  Unless the person gets up and himself or herself on the aircraft wheel chairs, Airlines crew will not be able to extend any help to take people like us to use the toilet inside the aircraft.  They had made this clear to me before I started the journey while the air ticket was being booked for my trip to USA.  As the flight started taking off, my only option for me was to consume less water  as much as possible and eat very less food given inside the  aircraft.  As I had the opportunity to empty my bladder  at the transit airports,  instead of booking one flight  for the entire journey,  I had planned to stop in  two transit airports .  This arrangement helped quite a lot to use washroom at the transit airports, without any issues during the journey.  Normally at the transit reports the security procedures take long time to check out and check in again to take a new flight . Hence, as far as possible travelers avoid changing at transit airports during their long journey.  But in my case,  I had to book my ticket by changing the flights at two places at Frankfurt and Chicago.  In the hotels too,  unlike India we do not get much support by the hotel staff as normally they will be very less number of staff in foreign countries unIike India where we can ask for help very easily. Hence to reduce the dependency on external help I had hired motorized wheelchair in US during my stay. So I completed the entire journey successfully and came back to India after conducting the workshop for two days and stayed in US for almost four days. \r\n\r\nAgain I got an opportunity to travel to the Boston to attend a conference, I was to lead one of the group as a facilitator, from South Dakota . This time, I had determined not to face the difficulties in aircraft as I had experienced in my last trip to the US.  Somehow  I wanted to find an alternative solution to manage my  bowel and bladder. Hence I consulted the Head of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in Bangalore to ask for solution if any alternative techniques are there to manage bowel and bladder during the flight journey.  So the doctor whom I consulted taught me a different technique which was little complicated to insert a catheter and also warned me to take caution by myself.  This is normally done by nurses in the hospital when patients are immobile, when they get admitted . I learnt how to use the catheter and connecting it to the urine bag which is tied to my one of my legs (covered by trousers) throughout the journey. Now I was in a position to drink more water without any hesitation as the excess quantity would get collected in the urine bag, in case the bladder becomes full. After adopting this new technique the journey to the Boston and back home  become quite smooth this time. I completed my whole journey successfully without much of a problem and also without asking any support in the aircraft by aircraft crew. This was one more breakthrough to say How I became unstoppable, irrespective of the situation.\r\n\r\nAcitivity:\r\n\r\nActivity:\r\n\r\nCoach will give an overview of the 90 days Action Plan, \r\n\r\n1.

Just in time he got an offer to take over as the Head of Manufacturing at L&T Indore. By then I had finished my education, but needed his help. I remember my mom and dad\'s conversation- \"It\'s a great position, has good money.

Going forward in our program you people will be able to realize each and every phase of your life and why was it happening that way. Though I loved myself so much I have this habit of giving abundant love to people around me too. I enjoyed company of every fellow being nevertheless good or bad. I was being open everywhere and people who liked me stayed with me and others I never cared. My parents have been my biggest blessing in life. Tpday what I am is all because of my parents and with time my obsession for my parents increased so much that I couldn’t stand or wait until they are home if they go out. The moment they don’t pick the phone or come late a million negative thoughts pop up and I used to cry get depressed and worried so much. That was optional, I could have made my mind more clear stating its not required and still I was feeling good about worrying so much about parents and I was continuing that practice. It then turned out to be a practice that I start worrying about everyone around and I used to feel good or may be great about myself. After years one fine day I realized from others behavior that I don’t matter them so much. They used to not worry or think as much as I do and this brought anger and arrogance into my life.I became more ferocious learing the fact I was more loving than others. Then with time through meditations and other practices that I do on a regular basis I realized that no one else can get you happiness as much as you do to yourself and that’s the best way to stay happy. Now I am least bothered, Its not like I don’t care or I don’t want I just realized that boundary limit until where others must be prioritized in our lives\r\nP2 Story :\r\nLoving myself has changed me drastically.One small example is that when I was young I was fat more darker and I never cared for myself.With time as I was growing up I understood the importance of grooming and then I used to hate myself the way I look,I was more irritated for being born this way and I was always disappointed which always resulted I disappointment news in life.Again my parents the boon for my life started worrying about my health and my behavior traits.I am someone who is so stubborn so inorder to seed good habits into my life my parents started following.They used to wake up early,go for a walk,drink water and do all sorts of healthy habits.In the start I dint consider that well but with time I started with small small practices which are now part of my life and I do them unconsciously.Then when we go for walk or do some exercise for body in the morning this harmone that is produced makes us happy and then they started with healthy diet and al these sorts of positive intake into body started bringing me changes.When I used to see the big belly of mine then I used to punch myself or hit myself scoulding my belly as it was something that I dint need but with time I realized it only goves pain and I am actually hurting myself or insulting I started to speak tings to my bpdy I used to say softly I talk to myself very lovingly to get things done.Thats how we talk to kids when we want them to isten to us roght.This is how loving myself in wach phse brought lot of changes which obviously made me stand here today\r\n'),

What out come you desire from your business.\r\n\r\n	Step 2: \r\n	Realising what you really need is breakthrough in your perception. When we first came in Bangalore we had lots to struggle. We were having hard time figuring out how get the profits out this business. We had few PyraVastu expert who used to take materials form us and they pay us. But this is not giving us the profit we actually desired and we were thinking if we had made a mistake or what. We were looking for profits on single bills and it was next to nothing and our interest in this business was reducing. After going through data sheets and consulting other business expert in our field we found that we have to go on big scale to make profit other wise we could not survive. We realised that we need proper placement of business. We have set standard in our business, we had to make some videos and some quality teaching to our existing pyra vaastu experts so that can do better performance and thats how started this coaching in pyravaastu. Need is mother of invention. We needed to setup a new platform where Pyravastu expert can trust on they can have good results.\r\nAll this things does not happened in 1 day but we had to pray, we had to put our wishes in Wish pyramids, we constantly prayed of Pyra fire instrument to show us new way.\r\n\r\nSo what you really need that you have to find out and that will make a breakthrough in your business. Check your business, what you are doing and where you are missing, find what you really need. I will guide you to achieve that.\r\n'),

(312, 198603, 1, 'c', 'Story 1–  This is the story about my schooling and how I dreamt of getting job for myself and only objective I had to secure good job and earn fixed monthly income and after getting job, I started switching company to companies and within company department to department hoping that I will find my happiness and dream Job but I suffered 10 long years in corporate and eventually realised working is just my profession it was never my passion and then I was struggling to find answers on what the hell I really want in my life  and that took 3-4 long years to figure out what am I really passionate about.\r\nWhen I was in school just like any other common student, I just wanted to somehow finish my education so that I could get Job and earn some money to look after my family. I  Didn’t have any other aspiration except getting into good company and work at reputed position, I completed my graduation and then did MBA and managed to get myself good Job and worked as Sr. Manager in Corporate for more than 10 years then I realised that working 9-5 pm in corporate and earning fixed monthly salary was not I wanted in life, it just happened to be my ambition because of the family financial circumstances and since my school days I was desperate to get job and work and earn because of the financial condition I saw when I was teenager. Infact my family also had lot of expectation from me being elder son, my parents always had big hope from me that their son would do something good in life so that younger brother can also follow my footprints, being belonging to lower middle class family I think these kinds of expectation are very common. After so many years of working I realised that my job is just my Profession and This is not my passion which I want to follow entire my life, but then the big question I had what the hell I really want from my life, I switched from one company to other and within company I moved to different departments hoping that new roles and responsibilities probably going to help me figure out what I really want? Earlier I thought I am the only person who has these kind of problem and while talking to other colleagues of mine I realised that a huge problem many people don’t even know what they want in their life, my friends and colleagues used to call me and share the same problem  I know how exactly it feels when you want to do something else but really don’t know what is that one thing which really excites you and that thing which can drive you entire your life, but you must do other things to keep moving because of Money issues, Responsibilities and lots of family expectations. one day I was sitting down and was completely depressed then I put together the system which really worked for me, I found my real passion using my process and system and today I can do whatever I want to do in my life without being bother about issues like money, family and what people will think!  \r\n\r\nStory 2- In this data point I will give references and experience of my childhood how I have seen my father doing struggle in life, how he sacrificed everything for his family and siblings and I started following same belief that I have to sacrifice everything for my family and siblings and I caught into such borrowed belief system that I don’t have any control on my thoughts and actions because it will affect my family, and I started believing that struggle is part of life and everything is very difficult in life and all the success and money comes only to rich people, and after so much pain and struggle how I have changed my belief system and started working on my thoughts which changed me as person and in terms of my decisions and slowly I started working onto my passion and turned my life from victim of borrowed belief system to decision maker of my life !\r\n\r\nStory 3 -  In this story I will cover references from my life about confusing situations as I used to look at other’s success and just wanted to follow their footprint and if I heard someone saying that there is huge potential in business I wanted to start my business and sometime I wanted to try hands on singing and sometime I wanted to do something very unconventional but really was fickle minded what to do ,what not to do ? whom to consult, whom not to consult ? so I have gone through that situation for almost 3 years and then arrived at conclusion that I wanted to follow my passion of Coaching others, I implemented my system and process which started producing results and with help of that I overcame the fickle minded situation and started my journey on my own Passion!\r\n\r\nStory 4-  After 10 years of corporate experience my life was running of slow track with fixed monthly salary and comfort in my job, I had fixed daily routine every morning wake up for office , get ready finish breakfast go to office, have lunch , have meeting , finish work and come back home every day same boring routine and I used to look forward for  weekend so that I could get some time to go out my family and friends, off course there was comfort zone in life but things were not according to my choice in office, every day after office hours I used to think what the hell is happening in my life , why am I wasting time on things which are not important in my life , I used to check social media pictures of friends and used to think people are enjoying their life and I am wasting time in same company for last many years where my salary is not very high, I am working just to survive in Mumbai and don’t have any bank balance and can’t even plan abroad trip annually don’t have money for it ,don’t have car, don’t have house and even don’t have any huge savings for future, but I was okay with my same old colleagues ,my same boss, my same company and whenever I used to have conversation with my colleague everyone has similar story but all of them were equally comfortable with their job and didn’t even consider to quit or change job, because there is no certainty if new job would be equally okay, what if I get worse boss then this and what if I get working culture which I am not comfortable with. In 2016 my daughter was born and that was the time my wife had to quit her job and entire financial burden came onto me and within 2 years’ time I was running out of cash it was a kind of situation that my salary used to get credit on 10th of every month and by 15th of every month I was out of cash and started swiping credit card and then even applied for multiple credit cards to look after my monthly expenses, already my life was sucking me and now I was in a kind of situation where I don’t have money, I am stuck with same old company on same old salary and I’m not ready to switch my job even when I was suffering financially and professionally being in same company for so many years. And whenever I used to have conversation with friend and colleague they used to tell me same stories of their struggle and I was thinking if they can manage with their salary and with same company then probably I’m over thinking that’s the way to live life and I saw my dad also managed within his fixed monthly salary and struggles whatever he has gone through so I accepted and compromised with all situations and managed to convince my mind there is nothing wrong in these scenario and was suffering badly but was not ready to change these circumstance because I believed that these are pretty common issues and then things started becoming even worse for I used to take money from my friends and could repay them on time, I started getting calls from credit card companies and even in my office things were not going easy and in my favours I used to have lot of conflicts with colleagues and boss ,cross functional teams and I was not able to sleep thinking that why the hell my life is like that , I was suffering badly but were not ready to learn how to change these circumstances , how to find happiness and how to improve financials, and how to follow something which I really enjoy rather that wasting time of something which I really don’t enjoy, then when I started working on my system and started following that within 3 months I had completely different positivity in my thoughts and started learning towards how to change my scenario and  worked for my passion which get me happiness and learned things which really changed my life completely.'),

When I was not taking any training the objective of becoming trainer was looking impossible for me to achieve, and a kind of feeling that I earlier I has some feeling that I want to do something in training but didn’t know what trainer I want to be and from where should I starts my journey, I used to listen to people over YouTube and used to get inspired and used to think set goal for myself that by end of this year I will do this and that and my end of the end the goal was nowhere in my life because I didn’t even defined Clearly what I really want to achieve and to have some feeling to do something is great but it’s really frustrates when you want to do something and really don’t know what it is !\r\n\r\n\r\nStory 2-  I have a  friend of mine and I know him from last many years and often we speak about my life , office and personal matters and he keeps asking what are you doing this training and coaching and what your plan on this and one day told him what I am planning and what I want to do , I know very well that he is also just suffering in his job and he even knows it more than anyone else in this world but he just keep on thinking that one day things will be all right and he will get opportunity to follow what his heart says and whenever he discuss about following passion he give me many excuses that I have family responsibilities  and I want to invest on myself and learn things but I don’t have time to do all these and it’s not that easy what you say , it’s easier to say then get it done, in short he would never do anything in life and will keep on giving excuses and try to satisfy mind that it’s not possible and its very difficult to achieve and it’s all about destiny and only few people in the world get that opportunity to become rich by achieving their dreams. I used to have similar kind of thoughts in past and if you ask me four years back I had similar beliefs and everything was impossible for me apart from my daily routine job, and I used to think that very lucky people in this world get opportunity to follow their heart, and all working people like me are the ones who will continue to work lifetime, because I have seen my father, my relatives and my surroundings all were in job and they spend their lifetime following that fixed routine, year after year till they got retired and I had strong belief that the way to live life and I used to tell myself that if my father never did business or followed what he wanted to do in life how can I achieve and do something which I don’t have any clarity about. And then I thinking if I don’t take any action now my life would be same as it was years before and I don’t want to repeat same old stuff and ways of spending my life which I really hate , and question in front of me was what can I do and what can I learn to change this circumstances and how can start preparing my mind to learn and change the way my look at my life and then I decided to find answers to my questions and even invested huge money on myself and learned how can I think in focused manner without being affected by any internal and external environment and which really changed my life and now I don’t have any excuses and don’t have any fear of failure or anything which can stop me from thinking and following my passion. \r\n'),

But he has no knowledge about stock market and all he believed was that the analyst will help him do high profitable trades.\r\nHe used to check news occasionally. Once he saw the company Amtek Auto making highs every single day and it skyrocketed like anything. The share price has reached around 250 and he thought it is going to continue the trend and thought of investing the amount and get at least 10% and get out of the stock. \r\nHe invested the entire 50000 buying the stock at around 250. Unfortunately from the very next day the tock started falling from that level. He was thinking it was just a small correction and it would rebounded again. But to his bad luck, it kept falling, further and further. He now decided to hold it few more months and he was confident that it would reach the same level and go up in few months. But it kept falling further and further. The Stock price came to 25. He lost 90% of the investment. He now lost hopes on this stock and also on the stock market. \r\nHe was broke and depressed. The amount which was saved little and little every month got vanished in just few months.\r\nLearnings:\r\nI had a dicussion with him once and asked him what is the actual problem?\r\n•	He said there was a sudden bad news over night\r\n•	The stock revenue and profit were not good\r\n•	The whole market was in to downtrend\r\n•	Global scenario was bad\r\nI told him that these are not the actual reason for your loss.

(337, 607612, 2, 'c', 'Story 1:\r\n\r\nHello Everyone, let me tell you a liitle about myself and how my journey started.\r\nI\'m an average student in school and in my college and like you all, I had a lot of financial issues for my education and I completed it by taking bank loans. During this tough period of time, I understood the importance of money. I got a job in an IT firm after engineering and got around 18K pm. But I always dreamt of achieving financial freedom but achieving it is not that easy. I tracked a lot of buiness people and billionnaires to understand how they achieved financial freedom. Out of all there was one thign in common.\r\nSecondary Income and Passive Income\r\nI made a decision on that day that I should start finding ways of making secondary income and passive income. Buy How?\r\nI\'m not expert in any field to start making that money. So I started exploring on all the possible ways of making money.\r\nCreated a website.\r\nAffiliate Marketing\r\nTeaching on some random subjects\r\nVarious online methods etc\r\n\r\nFinally I came to know from Economic Times about Stock Market. I can see many people earning huge infact earning millions. I was shocked to read about these people. I read about alot more people until I completely believed that I can make money in Stock Market and its not something fake.\r\nI started learning about Stock Market from that day and finally happy to have found something that really works for me.\r\nIt has been 8 years and I happy to be successful in Stock Market. I faced a lot of pain and challenges during these 8 years and I doesn\'t want everyone else to face those challenges.\r\nSo I started training people who are really serious about their life and have big dreams to achieve. I have created a 4 stage system which worked for me and many of my students to make consistent profits in stock market.\r\nOne of my students is able to make 32% in just 3 months which is amazing. I want to spread my knowledge and my 4 stage system to as many as possible and help people achieve their financial freedom.\r\n\r\nInorder for a person to achieve success, a proper guidance and a continuous learning is more important. The are so many things that one should learn when it comes to stock market which you will be learning through my system.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nStory 2:\r\n\r\nLet me tell you about a person. He is not a famous person but he has a lot tell us though his life.\r\nIn the year 1980, there was this man who worked for his friend who worked for Wipro. This guy did the marketing for some of his products at that time for free. As a token of gratitude and effort and time he has put in for his company, the representative of the Wipro company gave this guy 100 shares for 10000. And the Journey Begin.\r\nThis guy is a great fan of the Wipro CEO Asim Premji and he was very happy to receive the 100 shares of his company.\r\nAfter 35 years, the value has grown from 10000 to 535 crores.\r\nYes, it is now worth 535 crores.\r\nBut how? lets get in to the number a little.\r\nThe total number of shares with him is 100 in 1980.\r\nThe company gave 1:1 bonus in 1981, so total shares now bocome 200.\r\nThe company gave 1:1 bonus in 1985, so total shares now bocome 400.\r\nThe company did stock split to Facevalue of 10 in 1986, so total shares now bocome 4000.\r\nThe company gave 1:1 bonus in 1987, so total shares now bocome 8000.\r\nThe company gave 1:1 bonus in 1989, so total shares now bocome 16000.\r\nThe company gave 1:1 bonus in 1992, so total shares now bocome 32000.\r\nThe company gave 1:1 bonus in 1995, so total shares now bocome 64000.\r\nThe company gave 2:1 bonus in 1997, so total shares now bocome 192000.\r\nThe company did stock split to Facevalue of 2 in 1999, so total shares now bocome 960000.\r\nThe company gave 2:1 bonus in 2004, so total shares now bocome 2880000.\r\nThe company gave 1:1 bonus in 2005, so total shares now bocome 5760000.\r\nThe company gave 2:3 bonus in 2010, so total shares now bocome 9600000.\r\n\r\nShare price of wipro was around 500 and the total value comes to around 500 Crores.\r\nI should not forget the dividend which was given to him in these 34 years which comes to around 100 crores.\r\n\r\nIn total, the value of 10000 has increase drastically to 600 crores in 34 years.\r\nDuring this period of 34 years, there were so many times people forced him to sell his shares for family expenses, functions, marriage etc but he never sold them. Even during so many crucial times, he never sold them. He was so patient and managed his money and he has now become an example for so many of us.\r\n\r\nThere are lot of things which we should learn from him.\r\n1. Thinking from a long term perspective\r\n2. Discipline and Patience are the key to success\r\n\r\nStory 3:\r\n\r\nIs Knowledge Power? \r\nOr \r\nIs Knowledge when put in Action is Power?\r\n\r\nWe all believe that Knowledge is power and it can take you to great heights. From the school days till the end of one\'s life, a person keeps building knowledge every single day. Till the age of 25, we may not have enough clarity on the future and one learns everything that comes in their way hoping that it will be helpful in some way in their future. But 99% of us are not clear about the future and keep learning anything and everything through out our life. \r\n\r\nWhy is that we keep holding ourselves for job security when we have good knowledge?\r\nWhy is that so many of us are not happy with the life we live, the job we do. \r\nWhy is that we are afraid of doing any thing new?\r\nWhat is the purpose of all the knowledge gained in ones life all these years, when one is not willing to put them in to Action?\r\n\r\nThere is a friend of mine who is very much interested in Stock Market Investment and has huge knowledge on the subject and he keeps learning every single day on them for the past 6 to 7 years. \r\nHe keeps analysing every single day and makes stock predictions. He even advices stock picks to his friends.\r\nBut on the other hand, he has never applied his knowledge in Real time Stock market for himself. When asked why are you not putting your knowledge in to action, \r\nthe reason he said is \r\n\"I don\'t have time\"\r\n\"I\'m completely occupied with the job\"\r\n\"Fear. Fear of Failing. Fear of losing money. \"\r\n\r\nWhen I heard all these problems, I remembered myself a few years back when I had the same issues myself. I know that with little guidance and support this person can do wonders. So I offered him to join my program \"Millionnaire Trading Formula\" which not only helps a person to gain knowledge on Stock Market Investing and Trading but also gives real time experience which boosts one\'s self confidence, discipline and eliminates fear.\r\n\r\nWith in just 3 months, he has successfully gained the art of Investing and Trading in Stock Market Realtime. He has now gained the confidence and started investing and trading. He even went further and started providing suggestions to manage his family and friends money as well. \r\nHe is now consistently earning passive income every month and he is now able to put his knowledge into action. He is now putting everything he learns into action with out any fear. \r\n\r\nSo Knowledge when put in to Action gives you power.\r\n\r\nStory 4:\r\n\r\nHello Everyone, when I started my career in Stock market I had no clue, no knowledge and there was no one to guide me. Whatever predictions I do it was a total failure. I spent hours to make one prediction but it again fails. With don’t know what went wrong every single day. I was so much worried about the money I was losing every single day. I was very much depressed as there was no one to support me both financially and on my predictions. But I never gave up.\r\nI waited for few months to get some money and I invested again in the Stock Market with so much of reading and analysis and this time I made more than 100% in a matter of 3 months and I was super excited but it didnot last long as I lost almost 90% of the profits  in just 1 month and I wa backto the same position again. I was overconfident this time and didnot do proper predictions and moved on with the emotions.\r\nBut there was one thing I understood that I was able to make profits for 3 months continuously and it means I\'m able to do it. I understood that there are few things that I need to work on.\r\n1. Controlling my Emotions\r\n2. Giving my 100% on stock predictions\r\n3. Most important : Discipline and Patience\r\n4. I should depend on numbers rather than my gut feelings and emotions\r\n5. Finally, Improving my Knowledge level every single day\r\n\r\nI have put a lot of efforts to follow the above points but I was able to do them and I\'m successful now.\r\nI now have complete discipline in my stock predictions and have a set of Rules which I follow to make my trades successful.\r\n\r\nOne recent example is that I analysed for over a month on Divis Lab and after thorough analysis I invested on it at 550 and with in a matter of 5 months it went up to 1050 and I was able to book around 90% to 95 % profits.\r\n\r\nI always say this whereever I go that \"Discipline and Patience is the Key to be truly successful in Stock Market\".\r\n\r\nStory 5:\r\n\r\nYou all know the famous person who is now a billionaire and is known as the Warren Buffet in India. Yes It\'s Rakesh Jhunjhunwala.\r\nThere is some interesting thing that everyone should know from him.\r\nPeople talk about his favourite stock or pet stock. What is that? Its Titan\r\nYou know why it is called his favourite stock. Let me tell you why.\r\nWhen Titan came to IPO. I hope everyone knwo about IPO- Initial Public Offering. It refer that the first time a percentage of the company\'s shares are offered to the general public.\r\nSo when Titan came to IPO it offered a price of Rs 3.\r\nRakesh sir did his analysis and came to know that this company is going to do amazingly well in future and he bought a major stake in it.\r\nAnd In 2018, you might have seen the same stock trading at Rs 1000.\r\nLets do a small calculation.\r\nIf he has invested 1 L he would have got 33333 shares at Rs 3.\r\nIn 2018, the total value of this share is 33333*1000 = 3,33,33,000. Which is 3.3 Cr\r\nTakign 1 L as investment, 3.3 Cr is the value.\r\nRakesh has invested in huge. I think you can imagine the value that this stock created for him.\r\n\r\nWhat has he done? He did his fundamental analysis of this stock and predicted that this will increase multifold in future and here it is.\r\n\r\nYou must undertand that alot of patience is required to hold on to a stock this many years. A normal person with out any knowledge on stock market would have sold it when it has increased to Rs 6 which is 100%. A person with little patience would have sold it at Rs 10. Because people want instant profits and they are not willing to wait for makin a fortune.\r\n\r\nOnly those who has the Knowledge to predict something and has the patience to wait for it to happen can be truly successful in Stock Market.\r\n\r\nStory 6 \r\nHello Everyone, let me tell you a liitle about myself and how my journey started.\r\nI\'m an average student in school and in my college and like you all, I had a lot of financial issues for my education and I completed it by taking bank loans.

I continued to learn with the hope that one day I will be successful.\r\nI understood that I cannot be successful if I don\'t have a system so I create a 4 stage system with all the learning I had so far and followed it no matter what.\r\nAnd I was able to make consitent profits in Stock Market and achieve success.\r\nIt has been 8 years and I\'m happy to be successful in Stock Market.
